I know it was for me.&nbsp;</p><p>In this tutorial, you will learn the few simple things you need to know in order to create a patch for WordPress that can be accepted into the core software.</p><p>While WordPress is open source software that anyone can download and modify, only a handful of core contributors are able to commit their changes to WordPress itself. If you'd like to make a change to WordPress' core files you can propose it either by creating a ticket detailing the proposed change and attaching a patch, or by attaching a patch to an existing ticket.</p><p>A patch or diff file is a file that details the changes you made to the source that a version control system such as SVN or GIT can use to apply your changes. Creating a patch is easy via the command line or via a GUI tool like <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">SourceTree</a>.</p><p>For this article, I will be detailing how to use the excellent GIT GUI app SourceTree to checkout the latest version of WordPress and create your patch file. You can use the GUI tool of your choice or the command line if you prefer.</p><h2>Find or Creating a Ticket in Core Trac</h2><p>When you submit your patch to WordPress core, it must be attached to a ticket in <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org" rel="external" target="_blank">WordPress' issue tracker, which is&nbsp;called trac</a>.&nbsp;Therefore, the first step in submitting a patch is finding or creating a ticket.</p><p>While it is possible that a new ticket with a new feature could be accepted, it is not very likely. WordPress has literally millions of users and it only makes sense that the lead developers are very&nbsp;cautious about introducing new features. Almost all new features are now developed separately as plugins first and only after extensive testing and development are they merged into core.</p><p>Your best bet for getting a patch accepted is to create a patch for an existing ticket. Recently core trac was redesigned to make it easier to find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/good-first-bugs" rel="external" target="_blank">tickets with easy fixes</a> and those that are most likely to be included in the next <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/minor/workflow" target="_self">point release</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major/workflow" target="_self">next version</a>&nbsp;of WordPress.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reporting Bugs</h2><p>If you would like to create a new ticket in core trac, which is a great thing to do if you have found a new bug you can do so <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket" rel="external" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;Just make sure that you have searched trac for any reports of the same issue before creating a new ticket and that you have verified the bug exists with the most up to date version of WordPress.&nbsp;</p><p>By that I do not mean the most recent release, but the master branch in GIT terminology or trunk in SVN terminology. I will detail how to get the latest version in later on in this tutorial.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/238/posts/20658/image/new-ticket.png"></figure><p>At the minimum, you must fill out the summary field, which is the title of the ticket, and the description field, which is the ticket's content. In the ticket's description, be as descriptive as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>At the 2013 WordCamp Orlando contributor's workshop, which I attended, WordPress lead developers Mark Jaquith and Andrew Nacin created this list of what goes into good bug report:</p><ul><li>steps to reproduce issue, starting with the&nbsp;earliest step</li><li>description of the bug</li><li>what you saw versus what you expected</li><li>error messages or error codes</li><li>PHP errors (what was the&nbsp;warning on page, what went in log, are there any JavaScript or Apache/ nginx errors?)</li><li>what browser?</li><li>environment (your&nbsp;PHP version, MySQL Apache or nginx version)</li><li>Does it happen with no plugins and default theme?</li><li>screenshots for user interface&nbsp;issues</li><li>be clear and concise</li><li>get to point first, then details.</li><li>related ticket number&nbsp;</li><li>one bug per ticket&nbsp;</li><li>permalink settings</li><li>Is multisite enabled&nbsp;or not?</li><li>WP_DEBUG or equivalent enabled?</li><li>user role logged in when the issue happened (or changed roles in database)</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that not all of these are relevant to every bug, but there more relevant information you can add the better.</p><p>Unless&nbsp;you are sure of what to set in them, you&nbsp;should leave the fields below description alone and let a core contributor use them to categorize the ticket accordingly. I would recommend that you use the "Has Patch" or "Needs Patch" tag based on whether or not you are attaching a patch to fix the bug or not.</p><h2>Checking Out the Latest WordPress From GitHub Using a GUI Tool</h2><p>Before creating a patch for any ticket, it is important that you have the absolute latest version of WordPress as it there are many changes made to it every day. It is impossible to know if your fix works or your bug still exists unless you are using the most&nbsp;up-to-date code. Your patch will likely not be accepted if it modifies code that has already changed.</p><p>WordPress is managed in SVN, but that code is mirrored as a GIT repository in two places:</p><ol><li><code class="inline">git://core.git.wordpress.org/</code></li><li><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress">https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress</a></li></ol><p>The GitHub repository is the easiest to use. Just keep in mind that even though it is the official GitHub repo, it is still not used for issue tracking and you should not submit pull requests to it.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/238/posts/20658/image/clone.png"></figure><p>There are many ways to get the latest version of WordPress via SVN or Git. Personally, I&nbsp;find the easiest thing to do is to use the great GIT GUI tool <a href="http://sourcetreeapp.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> to clone the GitHub mirror. This is as simple as selecting "New/ Clone" from the file menu, entering the address for the Git repo in the "Source Path/ URL" field and then specifying a local path for cloning, which would be&nbsp;inside of your XAMMP or Vagrant testing environment.</p><p>Speaking of Vagrant, the popular <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" rel="external" target="_blank">WordPress Vagrant configuration VVV</a> has a preconfigured testing environment for WordPress core, including the latest code and the unit tests.</p><h2>Creating a Patch File</h2><p>Once you have made the changes to WordPress that are needed to resolve the issue you are trying to fix and tested the fix you need to create a patch file to upload to the ticket. SourceTree includes a way to create a patch file or you can use the command line.</p><p>In SourceTree, you can create a patch file by going to your working copy, and right-clicking the file(s) that have changed. From the right-click menu select "Create Patch".</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/238/posts/20658/image/create-patch.png"></figure><p>Alternatively, in your terminal, navigate to the root directory for your WordPress repo and use this command to create the diff:</p><p><code class="inline">git diff —non-prefix ~/name.path&nbsp;</code>


<br></p><p>No matter how you create your patch file, you should name it after the ticket number it is intended for. If it is the second patch uploaded to the ticket append .2 to the end of the number, or .3 if it is the third and so forth. For example, the fifth patch for ticket #12358 would be called #12358.5</p><h2>Uploading a Patch to Trac</h2><p>Now that your patch is ready to go, you need to upload it to the ticket in core trac. On any existing ticket, under the description is an "Attach File" button that you can use to upload your patch. On the next screen be sure to add a description of what the patch does.</p><h2>Be Patient and Be Understanding</h2><p>WordPress is a massive project, so it is unreasonable to expect a response to your patch immediately. Also, understand that the standards for a patch being committed to WordPress have to be very high in order to best serve all of its users.</p><p>Once you've submitted your patch be patient and be understanding of any feedback you receive. The lead developers are very approachable, if you have questions about your patch or why it was not improved, feel free to ask one of them in the #wordpress-dev IRC channel.</p><p>While waiting for a responses and having to make changes can be frustrating, it's worth it when your patch is committed to WordPress and the changeset description acknowledges you.&nbsp;</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/20658/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/20658/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/20658/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/20658/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T15:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T15:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

How can we see transparent things? What makes a scene something more than a set of objects? How do you mix reflected colors? Learn tricks that will bring life to your realistic paintings!<br></p><p>This is the the last part of our mini series on color and light. In the first tutorial we <a href="http://design.tutsplus.com/articles/improve-your-artwork-by-learning-to-see-light-and-shadow--cms-20282" target="_self">learned how to see light and shadow</a>, and in the second one, the <a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/color-fundamentals-shading--cms-20549" target="_self">principles of color</a>. Today we're going to learn some advanced tricks that will give your artwork a real spark. The key word here is variety, in color and form. If sometimes the things you draw look like plastic figurines, this tutorial should help you a lot!<br></p><h2>Materials<br></h2><p>Most of the problems with painting colors lies in the depiction of surfaces. The surface structure influences our perception of color and brightness,
 and there are a lot of issues you need to take control of. When ignored, it can make for a dull, "plastic" scene. Plastic is the default material of every beginner's drawings—let's move past that.<br></p><h3>Specular and Diffuse Reflection<br></h3><p>In the previous tutorial I mentioned glossiness, but I didn't emphasize how important it is. In general, there are two kinds of color-making reflections: diffuse, and specular. Usually they're mixed together, and the proportion between them creates the overall reflection we perceive. So we can see matte, gloss, matte shine and all the stages in between. <br></p><p>As we noticed before, specular reflection is made by a ray reflected perfectly by the surface straight to our eyes. The more specular the surface, the clearer image of the light source appears on it. The less specular it is, the fuzzier the image, until it eventually becomes just a blurry spot of a diffuse reflection shifted to the light source's color. The shiny layer may be a property of the material, or just an effect added by water.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-12.png"></figure><p>It's safe to treat every material as partially specular. Even a rubber ball or a plush has a little bit of shine. Using various specularity levels for the materials on your scene is very important for diversity. Shine is so powerful that it's tempting to use it everywhere, but flooding all the scene with oil isn't really the way to an attractive artwork.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-14.png"></figure><p>A clear specular reflection doesn't always have the color of the light source. It works like this only if the "specular layer" (that's a simplification, but there's no need to go into technical details) reflects all the colors. If it doesn't, we get a red ball with clear green opalescence. It's a nice effect for gemstones, expensive fabrics, feathers (for example, ravens are black with blue tint) and the carapaces of beetles (blue tint on a green body).<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-13.png"></figure><p>The level of specularity should also be used to show how rough or polished the material is. A rough material after careful polishing will reflect a lot of light, so you should use a different specularity for an old wooden table and a polished wooden bowl—although they are made of the same material, their tooling made the difference.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-15.png"></figure><p>Texture isn't only about shape of a surface and the way it should be drawn, but also about the reflective properties of the material. Every surface is made of tiny objects, and they all react to the light source too—they cast their tiny shadows and have their little highlights. That's why simply pasting a half-transparent textured photo over the top of a drawn material doesn't always make it look "right". The finer the texture, the less this effect occurs, but you need to be careful with bigger ones, like scales or bark. Also, every rough texture drastically decreases overall specularity of the surface!</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-28.png"><figcaption>A rugged or porous surface (like skin) disturbs the specular reflection<br></figcaption></figure><h3>Fresnel Effect</h3><p>The perceived specularity of a surface depends on the angle of view. The sharper the angle, the clearer the reflection. This effect is very helpful in finding a perfect place to define glossiness of our material, and it also tells us when to treat water or glass as a transparent material, and when it should work like perfect mirror. You can observe this phenomenon on wet floor—the lower you keep your head, the clearer the reflection.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-48.jpg"></figure><h3>Transparency and Refraction<br></h3><p>Transparency is troublesome, because its intuitive definition is almost impossible to be conveyed into drawing. A simple change in the opacity of an object makes it look like a ghost, not like a glass. That's because our casual definition of "transparency" simplifies the issue.<br></p><p>Let's see how it works. Colored glass is easy to explain: for example, red glass absorbs all the colors, and only red passes through. Putting it simply, it works like a color filter.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-17.png"></figure><p> Intuitively, a fully transparent material lets all the rays through, without 
any absorption or reflection. But if the rays didn't interact with the 
material in any way, how would we be able to see the material?</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-16.png"></figure><p>If you read the previous paragraphs carefully, you should guess the answer—<i>only a 100% matte material reflects nothing</i>. So even our pure glass reflects a bit of specular reflection, showing us the surface. <br></p><p>An interesting fact: specular reflection is what turns a lake of transparent water into a mirror!</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-18.png"></figure><p>But how do transparent objects like water drops or glass cast shadow? This is based on <b>refraction</b>, the bending of the rays when they pass between two media. Including this phenomenon in your painting gives a transparent object a sense of volume—this is the difference between a solid glass ball and a bubble.</p><p>You should remember this scheme from physics classes. The only thing we need to remember here is that the thicker the material, the more likely the rays will be disturbed.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-19.png"></figure><p>The situation gets even more interesting when the surface is bent, creating a <b>lens</b>. Lenses have an amazing ability to focus or scatter rays. And when rays are focused (bent from their initial direction to one single point), areas of shadow appear. That's how a transparent lens creates a shadow!<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-20.png"></figure><p>Every transparent object with bent surface makes a lens. Every convex lens is able to focus light to some extent. Therefore, a wine glass, a bottle of water or a drop will all cast a shadow and very bright spot (or smudge, depending on how good the lens is) of focused light. If, additionally, the lens is colored, the bright spot will be colored too.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-21.jpg"></figure><p>But what does such a convex lens do? Of course, it magnifies! That's the most important thing you need to paint realistic transparent, solid materials. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-22.jpg"><figcaption>A bubble and a solid glass ball<br></figcaption></figure><h3>Translucency and Subsurface Scattering (SSS)</h3><p>What if material doesn't let the light completely through? What if it gets blocked somewhere along the way? Well, then we get a situation like below. The leaf is backlit, but it looks as bright as if the light source was right in front of it. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-23.jpg"></figure><p>The mechanism behind this is very simple. Some materials are <b>translucent</b>—they're not fully opaque, nor transparent. Light that seems to be absorbed inside them sometimes finds its way out, but before this it gets scattered, creating an illusion of internal illumination. Of course, the longer the distance our light needs to travel, the weaker the transmission.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-25.png"></figure><p>The most popular semi-translucent material is human skin. Subsurface scattering is the most visible in soft parts of our body, like ears or nose, but to some extent it can be observed everywhere. If you ignore this phenomenon, your painted face will look like a statue. Also, grass owes SSS its juicy green, as it comes mainly from transmission, not reflection.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-24.jpg"></figure><p>What does subsurface scattering do to color? The most conspicuous sign of SSS is highly increased saturation in a place that isn't directly illuminated. Brightness can be higher too, and the temperature of hue shifts to the color of light.<br></p><p>The mechanism of SSS on a human skin is a big topic, but I've got something extremely helpful for you—an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iryoku.com/separable-sss-released" target="_self">interactive human head model</a> where you can adjust all the options yourself and see how it works!<br></p><h3>Ambient Occlusion<br></h3><p>Multiple light sources, or just one light source naturally scattered in the scene don't leave too much space for edge-defining shadows. Therefore, there's a high risk of flattening the image or making it too "soft". To avoid it you can focus on the absolute shadows—those which will be there no matter how many lights you use.</p><p>Using ambient occlusion doesn't mean your objects need to look like 3D models (<a href="http://jiyu-kaze.deviantart.com/" target="_self">although it is possible</a>)—just define all the crevices. A good method for this is to imagine your object has been flooded with a non-stick dye. Most of it will run down, but some will be stuck in the crevices. The more dye there stays, the deeper the shadow.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-27.png"><figcaption>An example of an object illuminated by directional light and with ambient occlusion<br></figcaption></figure><h3>Fluorescence</h3><p>Some materials are able to transform invisible light hitting them into visible light. These objects seem to reflect more light that there is in the environment—they look like they're glowing, but they don't emit light on their own. This effect can be useful for magic things, plants, fungi and mysterious animals.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-57.png"></figure><h3>Emission of Light</h3><p>Sometimes we'll want to create the light 
source of some object of the scene. With all the things we've learned it
 should be a piece of cake! The brightness of our light source will define 
its power, and the hue and 
saturation are up to you—it's the source, it can be anything. 
Important: an illuminating object doesn't cast shadow!</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-26.png"></figure><h2>Scene Coherence</h2><p>I painted the picture below about two years ago. As you can see, the composition is great, the anatomy is decent, the colors are eye-catching, but...
 it doesn't look like a whole. Every object (dragons, reindeer, Santa) 
has their own set of colors and there's no relation between them. And 
how can there be no relation, if they're in the same scene, under the 
same light?<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-31.jpg"></figure><h3>Colorful Light<br></h3><p>Colorful light seems to be some additional, abstract topic. Sun gives us white light and it looks natural to us, and any colorful light needs to come from an artificial, man-made source. However, in the previous tutorial we noticed that sunlight is never perfectly white and neutral—it's either warm or cold. That leads directly to conclusion that it's white light that's artificial!</p><p>The hue of the light source affects all the objects in the scene, creating a coherent set. Look at these two pictures below. I'm sure you can easily tell which one is warm and which cold. They both look OK—the first one seems to be taken on a sunny day, and the other when it's more cloudy. What's important, is that if they weren't placed next to each other, you probably wouldn't even notice this yellow or blue tint! As we said before, color temperature comes from comparison.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-1.png"></figure><p>You may be familiar with the concept of white balance. Sometimes photos look too yellow, or too blue. This is because a camera takes a picture of what it "sees", and we don't only see, we have a brain that changes the image immediately and imperceptibly. A photographer needs to shift the colors to yellow (if the photo is too bluish) or to blue (if it's too yellow), but our brain makes this correction outside of our awareness.</p><p>What does this mean? You can tell when something is white even if it doesn't look white under some circumstances. Check it out in the evening, when everything is blue. You'll know a sheet of paper is white, even though it's not—it doesn't reflect full spectrum to you! It's called <b>chromatic adaptation</b> and it leads to various illusions, like the one below.<br></p><p>The circles on the right look red, blue and green to us. Our brain assumes the background would be white under perfect light conditions (like in the lefthand picture) and calculates the difference between the white and the actual background. Then it adds this value to the other colors.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-3.png"></figure><p>Of course, it's only an illusion. The colors are purple, blue and cyan, and these are the ones you should use in painting something lit by this kind of light source. In digital painting you can use a blue filter to shift all the colors to their proper hue, but it limits you to only one light source. How should you foresee how the colors will change under a colorful light? First we need to understand how it works.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-4.png"><figcaption>These are the same colors as in the righthand image above. Check in your graphic editor if you don't believe me.<br></figcaption></figure><p>Just for revision—when white light (made of all the colors) hits a red object, all colors except red are absorbed. Red itself is reflected to our eyes. A white object reflects all the colors. Hopefully you've got a good grip on that now, because we're going to take it one step further.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-5.png"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-5a.png"></figure><p>What happens if we remove all the colors from the light, leaving only red? Our red object will be the same red as before, but the white object, still reflecting everything, will reflect only red too! In fact, now both these objects are indistinguishable. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-6.png"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-6a.png"></figure><p>Let's leave only blue light now. This time the red object absorbs it all and nothing gets reflected—it appears black. The white object again takes on the color of the light.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-7.png"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-7a.png"></figure><p>But those were extreme examples—in nature it's rarely this dramatic. Usually colorful lights are made of all the components, and the objects aren't colored strictly in red, green or blue only. Let's create a more realistic situation and see what happens.<br></p><p>The object in the images below is dark green and slightly glossy, like grass. It's not pure green, but rather, a combination of green, red and blue. You can see some parts of the light rays in the first image were absorbed (this is what a plant uses for photosynthesis), but they each one was partially reflected. Now, if we change the light source to orange (a lot of red and a bit less green) the final image in our head lacks blue and a bit of green. It's still a green ball, but you can see the difference. This difference is crucial for the object to fit the scene under each particular light source.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-8.png"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-8a.png"></figure><p>You can easily replicate any of these experiments using your monitor as a color lamp—just wait until it gets dark, then open your graphic editor in full screen mode and fill the whole page with the color you need. But you don't need to do it every time you want to paint something that's under a colored light. To check how a color will change under a certain light, you need to answer these questions about the scene:</p><ul><li>What does the object need for its color to be shown?</li><li>What and how much color does it get from the light source?<br></li></ul><br><p>When we've got two colors—of the object and of the light—we need to find an intersection between them. A yellow object and a magenta light have the same intersection as a magenta object and a yellow light. Therefore, we're looking for an intersection of two colors, no matter which is which. To simulate this behavior digitally, you can use the <b>Multiply</b> blending mode.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-37.png"></figure><p>However, there's a funny thing about this mixing. Do you remember subtractive mixing, from the previous tutorial? This is just the same! It means you can use the four rules of subtractive mixing to foresee how an object will look under some light. Traditional artists shouldn't have any problems with this, but as a digital artist you just need to keep in mind a few other rules.<br></p><p>By reducing saturation you reduce the amount of "paint" and the presence of that color in the mixture. The brightness of the mixture is affected mostly by the luminance of the darker components. A small amount of paint means here your object is getting mostly white light, shifted slightly to another color.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-44.png"><br></figure><p>Brightness can be seen as the amount of ambient light in the environment. For example, in the night the light source should be dark blue, and in effect the objects should be dark too. In movies night is often simulated by strong blue light and the scene is actually bright!<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-45.png"></figure><p>The brightness of the mix drops quite drastically most of the time, and although it is realistic, realism isn't always welcome. For example, real night scenes are very, very dark, not romantic blue made by long exposure on your camera and a few edits in Photoshop. But we actually <i>want to</i> see this romantic blue instead of fuzzy shapes in the dark. So using perfectly calculated values of intersection isn't always the best way for a nice effect—like many things in art, your own way of estimating the final color forms a part of your style.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-46.jpg"><figcaption>From left to right: daylight (template colors), night (template colors with simple blue filter), night (colors shifted)<br></figcaption></figure><h3>Color Mixing: Reflected Light<br></h3><p>The process of reflecting light within the scene is crucial for 
making it a whole rather than a set of objects. It's a common mistake to
 shade every object totally on their own, which results in a fake-looking
 scene. Reflected light is nothing but a colorful light coming from a different direction than the direct light. Therefore, it obeys the rules we've just talked about.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-9.png"></figure><p>However, there's one more rule you need to remember. <i>Brighter light always beat weaker light</i>. It means that reflected light will never be stronger than direct light (it may be just exactly <i>as </i>strong, if it's perfectly specular reflection), and it will be observed in the shadow only. And if the reflected light is darker than the core shadow, it won't be visible too—there is no such thing as black light, only the lack of it. If you see a "reflection" of a dark object on a bright, specular surface, it's actually a kind of shadow—you see bright areas outlining the lack of reflection.<br></p><p>But reflection isn't only about what color is bounced between two surfaces. It's also about how and when it is bounced. So here come a bunch of simple rules that you need to keep in mind:<br></p><ol><li><b>Fully matte surfaces</b> don't reflect any light to each other;<br></li><li><b>Fully specular surfaces</b> reflect everything—they work like a light source with sharp edges. They are able to make the surface as bright as if it was illuminated directly by the light source;</li><li><b>Mixed surfaces</b> (slightly glossy or specular coated with matte) reflect as much light as there is specularity in them—the glossier, the stronger reflection;<br></li><li><b>Dark surfaces</b> are dark because they absorb a lot of light. Therefore, they don't influence matte objects. On glossy surfaces there may appear a shadow of them.<br></li><li><b>White surfaces</b> reflect everything—they brighten objects a lot.</li></ol><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-47.jpg"></figure><h3>Multiple Light Sources<br></h3><p>Let's talk some more about light sources. Since they create the color, they're crucial to painting a scene as we imagine it. We can distinguish many kinds of light sources, with the most characteristic being:</p><ol><li><b>Sunlight:</b>&nbsp;strong, but kind of diffuse light source. Its shadows can be soft or sharp depending on its power (e.g.: sun, fire, lamp);<br></li><li><b>Spotlight:</b>&nbsp;strong, directional light with sharp shadows (e.g. flashlight, sunlight passing through a hole); <br></li><li><b>Reflected light</b>: light bounced from an object to another;</li><li><b>Ambient light:</b>&nbsp;diffuse reflected light without a defined direction (e.g. sunlight reflected from the sky, light of fireplace reflected from the walls);<br></li><li><b>Transmitted light:</b>&nbsp;light passing through a translucent object.<br></li></ol><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-58.png"></figure><p>Mixing these light sources can help create a nice, appealing scene. Beginners often start with side sunlight only, since it's the most obvious. However, it creates dull shadows covering a big part of the scene. Ambient light helps fill these shadows to reveal the shapes hidden under them. On another level artists link all the objects on the scene by including reflected light. Sometimes transmitted light comes to play too. How to manage all this chaos?</p><p>Even if your scene seems to be flat, you'll need to use perspective for its lighting. That's a rule you can't break—shadows and highlights appear on forms, not on a flat sheet of paper. Side lighting is used the most because it's easy to place the light source mentally on the left or on the right of a 2D surface, but it's also overused and boring. If you want to take full control over the lighting in your scene, you need to plan it.</p><p>Let's say you want to draw a composition like this. It doesn't need to be that simple, but every scene can (and should) be simplified to primary forms in your mind.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-50.jpg"></figure><p>Now you can change your perspective. Take a sheet of paper and sketch your scene from above and/or in front view. This way you'll be able to place the light sources at any angle you wish. You'll also see how the objects interact and where the shadows are casted or overlapped. This sketch should be very, very simple - the details of objects will inherit their shading. You'll probably cope without it in simple scenes, but when things get complicated (uncommon light sources, a lot of transmission) it's indispensable.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-51.jpg"></figure><h3>Shadows</h3><p>When dealing with multiple light sources, including colorful ones, you may stumble upon a new problem—what happens to the shadows?</p><p><b>Ambient light</b> is known by its ability to color the shadows made by the primary light source. It'll never create new shadows in the light area, but it's able to cast its own shadows in the shadow area.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-46.png"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-47.png"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-48.png"></figure><p><b>Reflected light </b>is sometimes cast into shadow, coloring and brightening it.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-53.png"></figure><p><b>Transmitted light</b> is good at destroying the shadow of its object. Sometimes, when it's weak, it only colors the shadow as an ambient light.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-54.png"></figure><p>The rule of thumb has it that shadow should be a complementary color to the light. For example, blue light casts yellow shadows and vice versa. It's true only to some extent—we need two light sources to make it happen, and it's useful only if one of them is primary or secondary color, and the other one is white.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-55.png"></figure><p>This optical illusion is based on a very interesting vision mechanism called <b>color opponency</b>. Cones aren't the
 only middleman between what we look at and our brain. Surprisingly, the
 three signals aren't transferred directly—they go through three 
channels: <b>red/green</b> channel, <b>yellow/blue</b> channel and <b>light/dark</b> channel. That's why there's no bluish yellow—only one of these colors can go through a single channel at a time. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20549/image/color-fundamentals-shading-9-1.png"></figure><p>The main conclusion we need to take from this is that our brain doesn't see red because it <i>receives red</i> signal, but only because it <i>doesn't </i>receive <i>green </i>nor<i> blue</i> at the same time. When you see a yellowish (<code class="inline">RG</code>) shadow casted by blue (<code class="inline">B</code>) light source in the presence of white (<code class="inline">RGB</code>) light source, it's because the shadow (<code class="inline">RGB</code>) is a bit less blue than the light area (<code class="inline">RGB+B</code>). And for our brain, if it's not blue, it's yellow! Analogously, when something isn't bright, it's dark. It's the same with the&nbsp;<b>afterimage</b> phenomenon—a white screen becomes less red after long time of looking at something <i>more</i> red, and thus it gets a complementary tint (cyan).<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-56.png"><figcaption>Look at the dot on the left by 15 seconds, then look at the dot on the right<br></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's a very subtle coloring and if you ignore it, no one should notice a thing. I described it only because I hear this rule quite often, and people seem to use it without trying to understand it. Most of the circumstances that seem to confirm this rule are a result of ambient light coloring (yellow sunlight—blue shadow made by sky; orange lantern light—dark blue sky in the night), so when you see an oddly colored shadow, check the ambient light first.<br></p><p>And what about another rule of thumb: "warm light—cold shadows; cold light—warm shadows"? Well, yes, it's kind of correct, but only if you expand it: warm primary light— cold ambient light and vice versa. This kind of contrast is very pleasant to the eye, but it's not some kind of rule that must be obeyed everywhere and at every time. It's you who chooses the color of ambient light. And most certainly you shouldn't try to add cold shadows when your ambient light is actually warm!<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-49.jpg"></figure><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, that would be all the fundamentals you need to know about color. Of course, it was just a concentrated summary and you're encouraged to study all these topics further. If you think there's too much to learn, just remember—painting isn't easy! It may look so when a professional creates a masterpiece in a matter of minutes, but it's only because they have spent <i>years</i> polishing their skills. Painting isn't just about putting colors on paper or screen, it's about knowing how to put them, knowing where they come from, where they should and shouldn't be, and what they should look like. If you really want to be good, don't rely on your talent or feeling only. Take the time to master theory, all this boring stuff hidden behind art. You'll be surprised how many of your unvoiced questions it can answer!</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/108/posts/20679/image/color-shading-advanced-final.jpg"></figure><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/20679/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/20679/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/20679/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/20679/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T13:00:12.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T13:00:12.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

Using some automation techniques, you can get time to work for you. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to use two programs to run activities based on time: <strong><a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/alfred-cron" rel="external" target="_blank">Alfred Cron workflow</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://actproductions.net/clockwise/" rel="external" target="_blank">Clockwise</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to see how these programs work, I will automate the checking of your web site's status.<br></p>

<h2>Installing the Programs</h2>

<p><strong><a href="http://actproductions.net/clockwise/" rel="external" target="_blank">Clockwise</a></strong> is available in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/app-store.html" rel="external" target="_blank"><b>Mac App Store</b></a>. It is really easy to use and makes the creation and editing of timed tasks really easy. <strong>Clockwise</strong> makes use of AppleScript and shell scripts to extend functionality.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not up to speed on AppleScript, please check out the tutorial <a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-applescript--mac-3436" rel="external" target="_blank"><i>The Ultimate Beginners Guide to AppleScript</i></a>. I will be writing the script in Ruby. If you want to learn more about Ruby, check <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/series/ruby-for-newbies--net-18166" rel="external" target="_blank"><i>out this series on Net Tuts+</i></a>.</p>

<p>In order to use <strong>Afred Cron</strong> by Shawn Patrick Rice, you have to have <strong><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Alfred version 2.3</a></strong> and a <strong>Powerpack license</strong>. You can download <strong><a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/alfred-cron" rel="external" target="_blank">Alfred Cron from Packal</a></strong>. When it is downloaded, double click on the workflow and <strong>Alfred</strong> will install it for you.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're interested in workflow development for <strong>Alfred</strong>, you might want to check out these tutorials: Alfred for <a href="https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/alfred-workflows-for-beginners--mac-55446" rel="external" target="_blank"><i>Beginners</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/alfred-workflows-for-intermediates--mac-60557" rel="external" target="_blank"><i>Intermediates</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/alfred-workflows-for-advanced--mac-60963" rel="external" target="_blank"><i>Advanced</i></a>, and <a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/alfred-debugging--cms-20439" rel="external" target="_blank"><i>Alfred Debugging</i></a>.</p>

<h2>Website Monitoring</h2>

<p>If you own a web site, you will want to make sure it’s up all the time. There are for pay services that you could use, but not every blog merits a paid service just to monitor it. That’s where doing your own monitoring can help.</p>

<p>The easiest way to check for a site is with this simple Ruby script:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">#!/&lt;your ruby installation location&gt;/bin/ruby

#
# Include libraries used.
#
require 'open-uri'

#
# Data Storage files defined. These files contain
# a single number for quick processing.
#
countFile = "/&lt;your data file location&gt;/siteCount.txt"
UpcountFile = "/&lt;your data file location&gt;/UpCount.txt"

#
# Get the raw number of counts and increment it.
#
count = IO.readlines(countFile)[0]
count = 1 + count.to_i
IO.write(countFile,count)

#
# Get the number of the site being live count and
# increment it if and only if it is currently alive!
#
upcount = IO.readlines(UpcountFile)[0]

#
# The exception handling tells if the site is alive. If the
# site is not reachable, the "open" to read the site will
# throw an exception.
#
begin
	source = open("&lt;your web site address&gt;").read
	puts "Up"
	upcount = 1 + upcount.to_i
	rescue
		puts "Not up"
end

#
# Write the Upcount to the file.
#
IO.write(UpcountFile,upcount)

#
# If the upcount lags behind too much, say that the site is down.
#
if (count - upcount) &gt; 10 then
	`/usr/bin/osascript -e 'display notification "Site is Down!"'`
end
</pre>

<p>Save this to the file name <strong>checkWeb.sh</strong> in the home directory.&nbsp;</p><p>This script simply increments a number in a data file for the number of times it has run and the number of times the site was alive.&nbsp;</p><p>You just need to change <strong>&lt;your ruby installation location&gt;</strong> to the location of <strong>Ruby</strong> on your system. The default location for most Macs is the&nbsp;<code class="inline">usr</code>directory. To see where Ruby is, you can type this in the <b>Terminal</b>.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">which ruby
</pre>

<p>Copy the path this gives into the file.</p>

<p>You'll also need to change the <strong>&lt;your data file location&gt;</strong> to a directory of your choice, and <strong>&lt;your web site address&gt;</strong> to the web address of the site you wish to check.&nbsp;</p><p>I created a directory in my home directory called <strong>data</strong> for the data files. Now, open a terminal to your home directory and type:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">./checkWeb.sh
</pre>

<p>You should get an output of&nbsp;<b>Up</b> if your site is up. The script will also increase the counts in the data files.&nbsp;</p><p>If the up count lags behind the total number of counts by ten, the user gets a system notification. Unfortunately, this approach is manual since you have to launch it by hand. To be useful, this needs to automatically run every ten minutes or so.</p>

<h2>Clockwise</h2>

<p>The <strong>Clockwise</strong> application makes the creation of timed events very easy to do. Once you have it on the system, it sits in the menubar area.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Clockwise" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-01.jpg">
<figcaption>Clockwise</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you click on it’s hourglass icon, it shows you all of the timed events you have with it’s next trigger time. To create a new trigger, select the <strong>+</strong> at the bottom left corner. You can name it <strong>Site Check Timer</strong>.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Creating Site Check Timer Timer Configuration" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-02.jpg">
<figcaption>Creating Site Check Timer: Timer Configuration</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set the <strong>Timer</strong> to trigger every 10 minutes with the <strong>Run Forever</strong> option selected. Click the right pointed arrow in a circle under the clock on the left.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Creating Site Check Timer Actions Assignment" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-03.jpg">
<figcaption>Creating Site Check Timer: Actions Assignment</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is the <strong>Actions for this event</strong> area. Click the <strong>+</strong> in the bottom right corner to add a new <strong>Action</strong>. Clicking the top bar gives a full list of possible actions.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Creating Site Check Timer Setting User Script" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-04.jpg">
<figcaption>Creating Site Check Timer: Setting User Script</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can set up many types of actions here. Each event can run any number of actions. The one you want is <strong>Run user script</strong>.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Creating Site Check Timer Opening Script Folder" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-05.jpg">
<figcaption>Creating Site Check Timer: Opening Script Folder</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the <b>Available scripts</b> area, you will see a list of every script that <b>Clockwise</b> can run. You need to add a new script.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, click on the <strong>i</strong> in a circle to open the dialog for the <strong>Open folder</strong> option.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Creating Site Check Timer Copying the Script" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-06.jpg">
<figcaption>Creating Site Check Timer: Copying the Script</figcaption></figure>



<p>This will open a <strong>Finder</strong> window in the directory for scripts. Since <strong>Clockwise</strong> is a sandboxed application, it can only run scripts in this one directory.&nbsp;</p><p>Copy the script for checking the web site to this directory.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Creating Site Check Timer Setting the Script" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-07.jpg">
<figcaption>Creating Site Check Timer: Setting the Script</figcaption></figure>



<p>Select the script in the <strong>Available scripts</strong> dialog. Select the <strong>check mark</strong> at the top right of the dialog.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Creating Site Check Timer Finishing the Timer" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-08.jpg">
<figcaption>Creating Site Check Timer: Finishing the Timer</figcaption></figure>



<p>You will then see the <strong>Actions for this event</strong> with the script selected to run.&nbsp;</p><p>Click on the <strong>check mark</strong> at the top right of the dialog again.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Site Check Timer Running" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-01.jpg">
<figcaption>Site Check Timer Running</figcaption></figure>



<p>You will now see all of your timer events with the time till they will trigger. The <strong>Site Check Timer</strong> will trigger in <b>4 minutes and 50 seconds</b>.</p>

<p>When that time has elapsed, you will see the data files have the count numbers increased in them. The <strong>UpCount.txt</strong> file will only increase if the site checked was reachable. If the up count lags behind by more than ten counts, you will get a notification every ten minutes until you reset the count files.&nbsp;</p><p>You have just mastered time using <strong>Clockwise</strong>.</p>

<h2>Alfred Cron</h2>

<p>You might already have <strong>Alfred</strong> and you do not want to buy another program. You can do the same thing with <strong><a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/alfred-cron" rel="external" target="_blank">Alfred Cron</a></strong>. Once you install the workflow, type <b>cron</b> in the <strong>Alfred Prompt</strong>.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Alfred Cron" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-09.jpg">
<figcaption>Alfred Cron</figcaption></figure>



<p>First, you need to select <strong>Add a Cron Entry</strong> to create a new cron job. <b>Cron</b> is a timer that is a part of any unix style system.&nbsp;</p><p>On the Mac, it is really controlled by <strong>launchd</strong> agent. It is what <strong>Clockwise</strong> makes use of also, just a little more transparently. <strong>Alfred Cron</strong> just gives a nice frontend to the background launchd daemon.</p>

<figure class="post_image">
<img alt="Adding a Cron Job" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/71/posts/21183/image/TamingTime-10.jpg">
<figcaption>Adding a Cron Job</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set up the new job just as you see here, <strong>Label</strong> is <strong>Site Checker Timer</strong>, <strong>Execution Interval</strong> is 600 seconds, and the script is the same as before. You now have new way to check your web site.</p>

<p>The jobs with <strong>Alfred Cron</strong> only allow you to set a delay time between triggering events, while <strong>Clockwise</strong> gives you many more options. It all depends on what your needs are as to which one is the best.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Now that you have tools to manage tasks on a time table, go and master them.&nbsp;</p><p>Experimenting with different tasks is a lot of fun. For an exercise, make the counting script an Alfred workflow accessed by a timer using the <strong>External Trigger</strong> block. That’s an easy modification that’s easy to maintain.</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21183/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21183/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21183/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21183/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T12:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T12:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

It enables you to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set any URL you choose as the base for all relative URLs.</li>
<li>Set default link targets.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Base-ics</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element is defined in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section&nbsp;and you can only use it&nbsp;once per document. You should place it as early as possible in&nbsp;your head section so you can use it from that point on. Its two possible attributes are <code>href</code> and <code>target</code>. You can use either of these&nbsp;attributes alone or both at once.</p>
<h3>Example 1: Asset Loading Shortcut</h3>
<p>Let's say you have a site which stores all its images and CSS in a folder named "assets". You might define your <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag like so:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;base href="http://www.myepicsite.com/assets/"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</pre>
<p>This would then allow you to load in any images or CSS like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;base href="http://www.myepicsite.com/assets/"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;img src="image01.png" /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>
<p>The link to <code>style.css</code> would resolve to <code>http://www.myepicsite.com/assets/style.css</code> and <code>image01.png</code> would load from <code>http://www.myepicsite.com/assets/image01.png</code>.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Internal Page URLs</h3>
<p>What if you have a top level domain which redirects to something&nbsp;like <code>http://thisrocks.com/app/</code>&nbsp;and all&nbsp;internal links need to include&nbsp;<code class="inline">app/</code> in their URLs.</p><p>You might set your base URL like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;base href="http://thisrocks.com/app/"&gt;</pre>
<p>From there whenever you wanted to link from one internal page to another you could simply use:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;a href="anotherpage.htm"&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt; </pre>
<p>This link would resolve&nbsp;to <code>http://thisrocks.com/app/anotherpage.htm</code>.</p>
<h3>Example 3: Default Link Target</h3>
<p>You can also use <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> to set the default target for all links on your page. If you were to use:</p>
<pre class="brush: html"> &lt;base target="_blank"&gt; </pre>
<p>...any link that didn't explicitly set its own target would open in a new window. You can use the <code class="inline">target</code> attribute with or without an accompanying&nbsp;<code class="inline">href</code> attribute.</p>
<p>This functionality could potentially be useful for content loaded in via an iFrame, as you would be able to automatically have all links therein targeted to the parent frame.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
<p>While the <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> url can be handy, its drawbacks center around the fact that after defining it once you're stuck with it. You can only use it in a single way and it will then affect all URLs. Wherever you don't want to use the defaults set in your <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag you have to specifically override them.</p>
<p>Should you use it to resolve to your <code>assets</code> folder as we did above, and you later wanted to link from one page of your site to another, you couldn't do so with the common HTML of <code>&lt;a href="page.html"&gt;Page&lt;/a&gt;</code>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because with the base URL being <code>http://www.myepicsite.com/assets/</code> your visitors would be sent to <code>http://www.myepicsite.com/assets/page.html</code>. </p>
<p>As such you would have to override your <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag settings by using the absolute URL instead, i.e. <code>&lt;a href="http://www.myepicsite.com/page.html"&gt;Page&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3>In-Page Anchors</h3><p>When using <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> you can also run into problems linking to in-page anchors. </p>
<p>Normally, a link such as <code>&lt;a href="#top"&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;</code> would keep you on the same page but skip to the location of an element bearing <code>id="top"</code>, e.g. it would resolve to <code>http://thisrocks.com/app/article.html#top</code>. </p>
<p>However if you're using a <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag with an <code>href</code> attribute you'd instead be sent to the base URL with <code>#top</code> appended to the end, e.g. <code>http://thisrocks.com/app/#top</code>.</p>
<p>Again, in this case you'd have to override the defaults set in your <code class="inline">&lt;base&gt;</code> tag by specifying the page you want your link to be relative to, e.g. <code class="inline">&lt;a href="article.html#top"&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;</code>.<br></p><h2>Where &lt;base&gt; Works Best</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag is best used in a scenario where you know you'll be able to exert complete control over the use of all URLs, i.e. you know you'll be able to override the defaults as required. If you're creating a theme for a CMS where there are many unknown variables it's probably a good idea to leave <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> out of the mix. </p>
<p>However, if you're building a static HTML site <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> can be very helpful. This is the case even more so if you're using a templating language such as Jade or Handlebars that will let you place shortcuts like <code>&lt;a href="{url}#top"&gt;Back to Top&lt;/a&gt;</code>, so if you need to override default settings it's still quick and easy.</p>
<p>If you have a good idea what your project's content will be, and its use of URLs and links is fully under your control, you might find the <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag saves you a lot of time.</p><p>Read more about <code class="inline">&lt;base&gt;</code> at the W3C wiki and HTML5 spec:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/base">http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/base</a></li><li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-base-element">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-base-element</a></li></ul><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21399/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21399/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21399/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21399/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T10:06:34.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T10:06:34.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

It’s often seen before you are, so you need it to give the best representation of you that you can. For a fair few artists little thought is put into their showreel, as it seems simple compared to the art in which it contains.</p><p>This is true, everyone can put together clips and breakdowns in Premiere and add text to a start and end card. However why not tailor every attribute of your showreel to get you the job. Think of your showreel as an advert for you. Every part of an advert is aimed at getting you to buy the product, from the upbeat music to the flow of shots, this is how you need to think. Everything in your showreel needs to have been done to sell yourself. This subtle attention to detail can help differentiate two artists whose level of work is the same.</p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/66001741" frameborder="0" height="338" width="600"></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/66001741">VFX Compositing &amp; Roto/Prep Summer Reel 2013</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/joshparks">Josh Parks</a></p><h2>What I've learnt working in the industry</h2><h3>Employers only have your showreel to build up a picture of what you are like as a person.</h3><p>The look of your title card, &nbsp;spelling, music used, what your email address is eg. <i>Coolguy56@hotmail.com </i>(not professional), colours used, order of shots, as the first and last shots are generally your best pieces, why does the artist think these are their best pieces?</p><p>These all contribute to the picture that is built of you, so you need to be aware of this when creating your showreel. As well as being aware of the picture that you are trying to convey of yourself. Something else to bare in mind is that due to the busy nature of the vfx industry there's often no time to watch a showreel more than once.</p><h3>Know where your skills stand compared to other artists and learn from their mistakes</h3><p>It is massively important to know where you stand in the vast talent pool of artists. If you know that you stand near the top end of work that you've seen, then you'll be more confident giving a day rate that is closer to what you want, however get this wrong and you can be undercut by another artist. This also allows you to judge your realistic chances of getting a job.</p><p>Constantly watch showreels at different skill levels of both artists and companies. Really analyse what pieces work well, what doesn't, and whether the editing/timing of shots work? Be aware that other artists will be doing the same to you. Knowing your worth is an important part of being an artist that comes with experience, it can be hard to not be biased towards your own work so you need to really be honest with yourself, as this will help you improve quicker.</p><h3>Music on Showreels</h3><p>My personal preference is to have music on my showreels. My reasoning is that it gives you something to edit to and if done well, gives a nice flow to your showreel. Even with the accompanying sound turned off, the showreel will still flow and have a nice natural pace to it, which will give the showreel a more professional feel.</p><p>Another reason for using music to accompany your work is that you want your showreel to be a completely rounded piece. &nbsp;You wouldn't see an advert without music that has been added to enhance the products appeal, your reel is no different to this. Its an advert that sells you, the product. Music has the potential to enhance the feeling someone gets towards a piece of work, however it can also have the opposite effect. I've seen this first hand at companies before, in which full screamo has been used to accompany an artists work. This results in the showreel instantly being turned off.</p><p>If you choose to accompany your work with music, an easy way of editing to it it is by using beat markers. Here's how to create them in Adobe Premiere<br></p><h2>Beat Markers<br></h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>First import your music into Premiere, by <b>Right</b> <b>Clicking</b> in the left hand side.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/36/posts/21449/image/Cgtuts-Showreel-Article-1.jpg" alt=""></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Now to get our audio into our timeline, click and drag it down to the audio section.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/36/posts/21449/image/Cgtuts-Showreel-Article-2.jpg" alt=""></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>To lay down our editing beat markers we can play through our audio and hit the <b>*</b> key on the num pad. So it’s just a case of listening through and tapping the <b>* </b>key to the beat of the song.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/36/posts/21449/image/Cgtuts-Showreel-Article-3.jpg" alt=""></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>Once your beat markers are laid down, your imported video can be snapped to the markers.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/36/posts/21449/image/Cgtuts-Showreel_Article-4.jpg" alt=""></figure><h2>Be Nosey</h2><p>As suggested above, watching other artists showreels is useful to see how the artists who are getting hired are presenting their work. It is also useful in the fact that it may introduce you to a new technique or way of tackling a problem (breakdowns with brief descriptions are best for this). If you do spot something that you couldn't create, find out how it was done, as this is something that another artist is offering, that you aren’t. &nbsp;</p><p>First do all the Googling you can until you hit a wall, then email the artist. Not only will this introduce you to a new technique improving your skill, but it also doubles up as an excuse to network. You now have a valid reason to email an artist as another artist, which differentiates you from the other upcoming artists who email asking whether they can be given a job. This shows that you are professional in your thinking and working. Again this builds towards the image that people will have of you</p><h2>Q &amp; A with Some of the Industry's Best<br></h2><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/80989764" frameborder="0" height="256" width="600"></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/80989764">MPC Film Reel 2014</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/mpcvfx">MPC</a></p><p>Showreels are a very subjective entity. In order to give you a rounded view of the area, I put some of the questions that had been put forward to me, to some high up artists at MPC and a lecturer at one of the best VFX/Game Art universities. These are the people within the company who have the final decision on whether you get the job within their department. Below are their answers.</p><p><b>MPC are currently hiring at all their studios. You can find all the info here: </b><b><a href="http://www.moving-picture.com/join-us/">http://www.moving-picture.com/join-us/</a></b></p><h3>Doug Larmour</h3><p><i>MPC Compositing Global HOD</i></p><p class="question">Is a showreel with two pieces in it too short?<br></p><p>Not if you have nothing else you are proud of. Ideally you will show about two mins worth of your best material, but if you only have two pieces which are good, don't flesh it out with bad stuff.<br></p><p class="question">What's too long for a showreel?</p><p>I won't watch for longer than 4 minutes, so don't put your best shot at the end, stick it right at the front.<br></p><p class="question">Do you want to see render passes or is it all about the final outcome?<br></p><p>From a comp point of view, I want to see the final output and ideally the original plate - and a couple of layers in between isn't awful, but if you don't have access to those, then the final output on its own will do. We're fairly good at recognising what you've done.<br></p><p class="question">What's the most common mistake you feel that artists make with showreels?<br></p><p>They don't specialise it enough. At a place like MPC we need people to be 100% focused on one area, so as we can get the best out of it. So when hiring a comper, I have no need to see how well you model, so tailor make the showreel to the job you are going for. Don't send a generalist showreel for a comp specific job. Also - don't show work which you think is bad on your showreel just to show that you are able to do something. Putting something on your showreel is stating that you think it's good or the best you can do, so make sure it is.<br></p><p class="question">Do you watch showreels on mute?<br></p><p>Always - we don't do sound. The visuals have to stand on their own.<br></p><p class="question">When hiring how much is down to the showreel and how much is down to the interview in whether an artist gets the job?<br></p><p>Its the whole combination. If you have a great showreel but then can't back it up in an interview, then I am left asking how much of the showreel was your work. Similarly if you do a great interview but your showreel doesn't show me anything of what you have said, then it looks like you talk a good game but don't necessarily back that up with actions (it might show that you are a little lazy) - so the awful truth is that if you want a job you have to have both, a good showreel and do a good interview too. It isn't easy.</p><h3>David Mayhew</h3><p><i>MPC Groom Global HOD</i></p><p class="question">Is a showreel with two pieces in it too short?<br></p><p>Not at all. I would rather see a nice polished single project done really well than two average pieces.<br></p><p class="question">What's too long for a showreel?<br></p><p>Generally 2 minutes maximum for Mr. Again just focus on the best bits related to the role you are applying for. That way it looks like you are really keen on that particular aspect of vfx.<br></p><p class="question">Do you want to see render passes or is it all about the final outcome?<br></p><p>More important forbade lighting/gesturing compositing role. For a groom role, I like to see turntables as well as final shots. It's important to clearly state which aspects of the shot you have worked on if it was a large group project.<br></p><p class="question">Whats the most common mistake you feel that artists make with showreels?<br></p><p>Adding to much substandard work. Putting on lots of final shots and not stating which parts of the shot they were responsible for.<br></p><p class="question">Do you watch showreels on mute?</p><p>Occasionally, yes.</p><p class="question">When hiring how much is down to the showreel and how much is down to the interview in whether an artist gets the job?</p><p>The showreel is important. Only if I see potential on the reel will I request an interview</p><h3>Benjamin Bratt</h3><p><i>Roto-Prep Lead at MPC</i></p><ul><li><i><b>Author of:&nbsp;</b></i><i><a target="_blank" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rotoscoping-Techniques-Tools-Aspiring-Artist/dp/0240817044"><b>Rotoscoping Techniques and Tools for the Aspiring Artist</b></a></i></li><li><i><b>Twitter: </b></i><a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://twitter.com/bbratt"><i><b>@bbratt</b></i></a></li></ul><p class="question">Is a showreel with two pieces in it too short?</p><p>The number of shots isn't really the focus of a demo reel. If you've only got a couple shots that you're confident enough to put on your reel, make sure those shots are kick ass enough to get you noticed. You don't want to clutter up your reel with filler, just so you've got a couple extra seconds tacked on. Mediocre shots will detract from your stronger shots. Also, if you've only got a couple of shots, it will give you a chance to create an in-depth break down (assuming you've got all the layers/before/after components) to showcase how much work was done to the shot.</p><p class="question">What's too long for a showreel?</p><p>3-4 minutes would be pushing it. Streamline your reel so we see the good stuff right away</p><p class="question">Do you want to see render passes or is it all about the final outcome?</p><p>Breakdowns are a huge plus. Half the things we do are invisible, and even if your included a written breakdown saying "removed thing X", it isn't as impressive as seeing that thing disappear from the plate.</p><p class="question">What's the most common mistake you feel that artists make with showreels?</p><p>I've noticed that artists can sometimes become too attached to particular shots. They've taken it from start to finish, reworked all the major and minor details, and are intimately aware of every half pixel problem. After putting so much of your heart into something, it's hard to separate yourself from an objective viewpoint. I'd say the most common mistake is not getting enough objective, outside feedback. Put your reel in front of knowledgeable people that don't know you and have no idea about what went into the shot. And when these relative strangers give you their feedback, listen to them; take in what they say and try see their point. &nbsp;A fresh set of eyes might hurt, initially, but the end result will be greater.</p><p class="question">Do you watch showreels on mute?</p><p>Yup.</p><p class="question">When hiring how much is down to the showreel and how much is down to the interview in whether an artist gets the job?</p><p>50-50 with a +/- variable of 18. &nbsp;If an artist has a spectacular showreel, but isn't the best when it comes to the social/communication aspects of our job, the viability of that artist in the workplace has dropped a bit. On the other side, if a showreel is average, a positive attitude and willingness to engage during the interview process will absolutely increase the chances of a call back. Also, know the difference between appropriately knowledgeable and obscenely over confident. If you don't know something, express a willingness to learn it.</p><h3>Richard Baillie</h3><p><i>Roto-Prep Global HOD</i></p><p class="question">What's too long for a showreel?</p><p>You want a showreel of about 2-5 minutes (and 5 minutes is probably pushing it) keep it relevant and varied.</p><p class="question">Do you want to see render passes or is it all about the final outcome?</p><p>For roto/prep we don't really have render passes. It's always nice to see the plate before prep and after, and then the comp. If you can put in alpha mattes that's always nice. If you can only put the comp on make sure you know exactly what you did in the shot and make sure you can talk about what you did, and how you did it, if asked in the interview.</p><p class="question">What's the most common mistake you feel that artists make with showreels?</p><p>Rushing through the passes leading up to the comp. If you've included them, allow the viewer to see them. Also as I see a lot of showreels straight out of uni, I see a lot of stock footage used in the same way. Try and make it stand out somehow from your classmates.</p><p class="question">Do you watch showreels on mute?</p><p>Yes.</p><p class="question">When hiring how much is down to the showreel and how much is down to the interview in whether an artist gets the job?</p><p>The showreel gives a good indication of the final products that someone can make. But only the interview gives an indication of their thought processes and them as a person.</p><p>A showreel won't show how long something took to make. It gives a good basis to conduct the interview on, it gives a reference point if I want to talk about the shot. I would consider an interview because a showreel is average or outstanding. A great interview will save a mediocre showreel, but an outstanding showreel will not fix a dreadful interview. The interview will give me some idea of what that person will be like on a day to day basis and with other people.</p><h3>Mark Walman</h3><p><i>Lecturer at the </i><a target="_blank" rel="external" href="http://uhanimation.co.uk/"><i>University of Hertfordshire</i></a></p><p class="question">Is a showreel with two pieces in it too short ?</p><p>If a showreel had just one piece of work in it, but the work was amazing, that would be enough. It is always quality over quantity.</p><p class="question">Do you want to see render passes or is it all about the final outcome?</p><p>Seeing render passes is very useful. &nbsp;As deadlines get smaller and smaller for commercial projects the ability to alter things after render is a must. &nbsp;As well as the usual passes (reflection/spec/occl) it is good to see relighting passes/ lots of layers for dust. If your film has dust in it they are sometimes used.</p><p class="question">Do you watch showreels on mute?</p><p>Yes, unless there is a lip sync in there.</p><p class="question">What's the most common mistake you feel artists make with showreels?</p><p>Adding old/bad pieces of work to show "how much they have progressed". Also make it very clear what parts of the shot you worked on. Adding subtitles can be useful.</p><p class="question">When new students apply how much is down to the showreel and how much is down to the interview in whether and artist gets the job?</p><p>A good showreel is your foot in the door.

There are the two or three I created as a teenager, with usernames like hotgirl13@aol.com and spockluvr285@yahoo.com, and the other accounts I created as I outgrew my old usernames or found a new email service to try. While I’m happy to let most of those go, I still get important messages that I don’t want to miss in some of my less-used accounts. I’m just not up to checking four or five email addresses throughout the day, though. It’s not the work of keeping up with so many logins, it’s that I’ll forget to check them at all for days on end.</p>

<p>The solution, then, is to create a single, unified inbox that collects all of my emails in one place. All of my emails flow into one inbox, and I can respond using any email address. Creating a unified inbox that collects all of your emails isn’t as complicated as it sounds, and I’ll show you how to make it happen. </p>

<h2>Use Gmail to Forward Email</h2>
<p>Log into the Gmail account from which you’d like to forward email. In practice, this would be a secondary email account that you use less. All of the email from this account will be funnelled into another email account, likely your primary account checked much more frequently. In this tutorial, I’m forwarding email from one Gmail account to another, but Gmail can forward to any email service.</p>

<p>
In the secondary Gmail account, click the gear icon to the right and select <b>Settings</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Locate Gmails settings" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox.png"><figcaption>Locate Gmail's settings.</figcaption></figure><p>Click the <b>Forwarding and POP/IMAP</b> tab and locate the <b>Forwarding</b> settings.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Find the Forwarding tab" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 1.png"><figcaption>Find the Forwarding tab.</figcaption></figure><p>Click <b>Add a Forwarding Address</b>, and enter your primary email address. Click <b>Proceed</b> to continue.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Enter the email address that will receive your forwarded email" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 2.png"><figcaption>Enter the email address that will receive your forwarded email.</figcaption></figure>

<p>
Gmail will send a verification email to the primary email address entered.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Click Proceed to continue" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 3.png"><figcaption>Click Proceed to continue.</figcaption></figure><p>
<b>Tip:</b> If your primary email address is also a Gmail account, log in by clicking the user image in the top right of the Gmail window and choosing <b>Add Account</b>. Connecting the two accounts in this way will allow you to quickly switch back and forth between accounts during the confirmation process without logging in or out.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Connect two Gmail accounts to make switching inboxes easier" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 5.png"><figcaption>Connect two Gmail accounts to make switching inboxes easier.</figcaption></figure>

<p>
In the confirmation email, you’ll find a <b>confirmation code</b> and <b>confirmation link</b>. Enter the confirmation code in the <b>Forwarding and POP/IMAP</b> tab in the secondary Gmail account, or click the confirmation link in the email. The secondary Gmail account is now forwarding to the primary email address.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Enter the code or click the link to complete the forwarding process" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 6.png"><figcaption>Enter the code or click the link to complete the forwarding process.</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Send Email as Another Account</h2>
<p>That’s great, but what would make this really run smoothly is if email sent from a Gmail address could appear as if it’s coming from another email account. I’ll show you how to send email from other email providers in Gmail.</p>

<p>
In Gmail, click the gear icon to the right and select <b>Settings</b>. Choose the <b>Accounts and Imports</b> tab.</p>

<p>
Within <b>Send Mail As</b>, click <b>Add Another Email Address You Own</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Gmail allows you to send email as another account" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 9.png"><figcaption>Gmail allows you to send email as another account.</figcaption></figure>

<p>
Enter the secondary email address. You may also edit the displayed name and specify a different reply-to address.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Enter the email address youd like to send mail as" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 10.png"><figcaption>Enter the email address you'd like to send mail as.</figcaption></figure>

<p>
When prompted by Gmail, send the verification message to the secondary email address. In the verification email, you’ll find a <b>confirmation code</b> and <b>confirmation link</b>. </p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="Send the verification email" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 11.png"><figcaption>Send the verification email.</figcaption></figure><p>
Enter the confirmation code in the <b>Verification</b> window in Gmail, or click the confirmation link in the email.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="Enter the code or click the link" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 13.png"><figcaption>Enter the code or click the link.</figcaption></figure><p>The Gmail account may now send email as the secondary email account. Repeat the process for all of the email addresses you’d like to use in Gmail.</p><p>
When complete, there will be a new <b>From</b> dropdown in the <b>Compose New Message </b>window. Repeat this process for as many email addresses as you own.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Select the address from which you would like to send email" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 20.png"><figcaption>Select the address from which you would like to send email.</figcaption></figure>


<h2>Set a Default Send Mail As Address</h2>
<p>While you can select from which address you’d like to send email in the <b>Compose New Message</b>&nbsp;window, it may happen that you more often want to send email from your Outlook or Yahoo email addresses than from your Gmail email address.</p>

<p>
In that case, it makes sense to set another email address as the default <b>Send Mail As</b> address in Gmail.</p>

<p>
Again, click the gear icon to the right of the Gmail window and select <b>Settings</b>. Choose the <b>Accounts and Imports</b> tab. Displayed here are all of the email addresses with which you can send email within Gmail.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="All of your connected email addresses will be listed" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox26.png"><figcaption>All of your connected email addresses will be listed.</figcaption></figure>

<p>
Click <b>Make Default</b> next to the email address you will use most often to send email.</p>

<p>
Next time you compose a new email, the default <b>Send Mail As</b> address will be automatically selected in the <b>From</b> field.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Emails sent with Gmail will appear as though they came from another account" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 21.png"><figcaption>Emails sent with Gmail will appear as though they came from another account.</figcaption></figure>


<h2>Organize Email Sent to Different Addresses</h2>
<p>In an inbox of thirty messages, it may not be obvious what’s important and what isn’t, which emails were sent to each address. Gmail filters and labels can help keep all of those different email addresses straight in your inbox.</p>

<p>
Click the gear icon to the right of the Gmail window and select <b>Settings</b>. This time, select the <b>Filters</b> tab.</p>

<p>
Select <b>Create a New Filter</b> at the bottom of the window.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Create a new filter in Settings" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 22.png"><figcaption>Create a new filter in Settings.</figcaption></figure>

<p>
There are many options for your filter, but for this tutorial, you only need to complete one of the fields. In the <b>To</b> field, enter a secondary email address that is being forwarded to your primary Gmail account. Click <b>Create Filter With This Search</b>.</p>

<p>
Gmail can do a lot with a filtered message, and it’s best if you decide how you want to receive your forwarded messages yourself. Would you like them all marked as read and archived, or should they be starred as important?</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Apply a label to messages matching the search" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 23.png"><figcaption>Apply a label to messages matching the search.</figcaption></figure>

<p>
I’m going to allow Gmail to handle the forwarded messages as usual, but I want to add a label so I know to which account the message was sent. Click the <b>Apply the Label</b> checkbox and choose a label from the list.</p>

<p>
If you haven’t created a label to handle forwarded messages from the secondary email address yet, select <b>New Label</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Create a new label" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/128/posts/21305/image/gmailinbox 24.png"><figcaption>Create a new label.</figcaption></figure>

<p>
Enter a name for your label and click <b>Create</b>.</p>

<p>
If any previously received messages meet the filter’s criteria, you may also apply the filter to those messages, too.</p>

<p>
Click <b>Create Filter</b> when you’re done. All messages addressed to the secondary email address will receive the new label.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While it may seem like you have to abandon old email accounts or schedule time to check various accounts still in use, with a little effort, you can get all of your email in one Gmail inbox.

computer audio geek, I would probably go all out (on a not-so-very
long limb) and say Audio Ease's Altiverb plugin is the best and
possibly only reverb plugin anyone could ever need.  I would use a
lot of clichéd modifiers like 'lush', 'gorgeous' and the omnipresent
'powerful' to describe its sound and functionality, and probably speak
on the 'painstaking' or 'intricately detailed' development process.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;But, I am not a gusher and avoid much of that type of language –
yet do find extreme difficulty in doing so
here, as Altiverb is simply just that good.</p><h2>What Is Altiverb?<br></h2><p>Altiverb is an ultra-high quality
convolution reverb plugin made by the Dutch company Audio Ease.  A
convolution reverb is a purely digital type of reverb that works by
imparting a pre-recorded room response (impulse response, or IR) on a
stream of incoming audio.  In other words, the room reflections of a
specific space are recorded and then imparted onto a piece of digital
audio, resulting in the illusion of that audio event occurring in the
pre-recorded space.<br></p><h2>Main Interface<br></h2><p>Altiverb's interface can be broken down
into six basic sections.  The library section grants access to the
extensive and ever growing impulse response library.  The main
control section contains the more brute force controls, while the
secondary control section deals with fine tuning.  The visualizer
menu dictates what is seen in the two visualizer areas below.  This
can range from pictures of the recorded room all the way to hidden
sound shaping parameters.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/trans.png"><figcaption>The main areas of the interface.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Library<br></h2><p>The Audio Ease team has spent years
traveling the world recording the reflections of iconic spaces 
throughout Europe, Australia and North America (primarily).  Clicking
on the library area will reveal the fruits of this labor in the form
of a detailed and well organized stock library of impulse responses. 
  This library is periodically updated by Audio Ease with free IR
downloads.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/library.png"><figcaption>The library's main page showing the IR's categorized by application and type.</figcaption></figure><p>Within each of these categories and sub
categories are hundreds of individual impulse responses of everything
from stadiums to stairwells to nuclear cooling towers.  The music
column on the main page consists primarily of spaces where one might
expect to hear music being played.  The post column  is geared
towards those working in film and consists of spaces where one would
have a conversation or expect to hear everyday ambient sounds.  The
final column is more geared towards sound design and leaves space for
user created IR's as well.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/teldex.jpg"><figcaption>The default setting is actually just one of a multitude of IR's recorded in Berlin's Teldex studio.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Controls<br></h2><p>Anyone who has used a reverb unit
before should find the controls pretty straightforward.  The main
controls to the left deal in the more overarching aspects of the
effect while the secondary controls along the bottom serve to fine
tune things.  Below is a brief rundown.</p><ul><li>The <b>reverb time</b> knob adjusts the level
of the reverb tail, thereby making it shorter or longer.</li><li>The <b>size</b> knob effects the apparent room
size by adjusting a combination of reverb tail length, early
reflections, and resonance frequency.<br></li><li>The <b>bright</b> knob glues a synthetic
higher frequency reverb to the already existing organic IR to create
the illusion of a brighter tail.</li><li>The <b>Input/Output</b> section to the
immediate right contains control for <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> level, as well
as wet/dry <b>mix</b> control.  The disclosure triangle opens up a small
menu of test sounds which can be activated and modified to sound
whenever a parameter is changed.</li><li>The <b>EQ</b> is a fairly straightforward two
band EQ (clicking the disclosure triangle reveals further parameters)
which effects the wet signal only.  The EQ bands themselves are
Baxandall EQs, which limit phase shift and all but eradicate frequency
cancelations when the wet and dry signals are summed.</li><li>The <b>damping</b> controls shorten or
lengthen the IR time according to specific frequency bands.  The
width of the affected bands can be adjusted in the disclosure menu.</li><li>To the far right are the <b>Time</b> controls.
 The <b>pre-delay</b> separates the time between the dry and wet signals and
the <b>attack</b> modifies the onset of the wet signal.  The disclosure
triangle unveils <b>direct</b>, <b>early</b> and <b>late</b> reflection gain controls as
well as a <b>reverse</b> button and <b>color</b> and <b>modulation</b> controls.</li></ul><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/controls.png"><figcaption>The interface showing the disclosed parameters.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Visualizer &amp; Menu<br></h2><p>The menu across the top of the
interface dictates what is made available in the two visualizers
below.  I've listed the more unique menu options below.<br></p><p>The <b>pictures</b> option displays the
available images related to the selected IR.  In the case of the
Teldex Studio, there are a few images of the studio, a diagram of the
recording setup and a surround picture of the space (similar to what
you would find in Google Maps).  These different views can be
scrolled through and expanded with controls located at the bottom of
the visualizer window.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/recording.png"><figcaption>The recording diagram of the Teldex Studio IR.</figcaption></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/studio.jpg"><figcaption>An image of the Teldex surround picture.</figcaption></figure><p>The <b>positioner</b> section reveals a 3D
soundstage in which the user can position the input sound source(s)
within the virtual room.  The speakers can be moved anywhere on the
grid and can even be uncoupled to create an asymmetrical stereo
field.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/stereo-field.png"><figcaption>The positioner option enabled.</figcaption></figure><p>The <b>waveform</b> section is worth noting as
it illustrates the four recordings (one of the reasons this plugin
sounds so great) which make up the impulse response.  In this
instance two speakers were used to create the initial sound and two
microphones were used to capture the reflections.  Each left to
right/right to left microphone and speaker combination was recorded
and combined to create this particular IR.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/ir.png"><figcaption>The IR waveforms showing the left and right microphone captures of both left and right speakers.</figcaption></figure><p>The <b>waterfall</b>, probably Altiverb's most
distinguishing visual feature, plots amplitude vs. time vs. frequency of the
reflection.  This 3D diagram can be moved, rotated and zoomed in on
from any angle and is constantly updated to reflect all pertinent
parameter changes.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/125/posts/21138/image/waterfall.png"><figcaption>The waterfall from the low side.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Sound<br></h2><p>I've just grabbed a few fairly dry
stock loops to test things out.  They are all mono (dry and mono tend
to go hand in hand) but will serve as a good indicator of just what

reverb out there.  It is a joy to work with and produces great
results every time with very little tweaking necessary.  It has an IR
suited for every type of program material and has an extensive
library of sound design and post production effects that I barely
have had time to touch on.<br></p><p>The one draw back is that it costs
$600.  Fairly high for a plugin, but a justifiable expense when taken
in perspective—cost vs. quality, importance of reverb as an effect,
the fact that it makes most other units irrelevant, and it's cheap compared to
hardware.  I tend towards the school of thought which promotes
using only a few high quality pieces of gear well so the price,
although still somewhat painful, was one I could live with.&nbsp;</p><p>It may
not be for everyone, but I highly recommend consideration towards its
purchase if you are looking for a high quality reverb that will
remain a prominent and cutting edge tool for years to come.</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21138/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21138/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21138/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21138/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T07:51:54.461Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-20T07:51:54.461Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

Coupled with WordPress, WooCommerce is a robust and flexible system that puts a range of powerful tools at your disposal to sell your products and services the way you want. And it certainly doesn't hurt that this full-featured, extendable and widely supported plugin is free to get started with, and that there's tons of great themes for it on <a href="http://themeforest.net" target="_self">ThemeForest</a>, plugins on <a href="http://enva.to/wooplugins" target="_self">CodeCanyon</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>But how do you go from building an online storefront to running a successful business? The key is to focus on improving your users' experience, so that shopping at your site is easy, quick and delightful. Let's go through a few ideas that you can use today to make shopping a pleasure for your customers, keep your site running smoothly and bring shoppers back time and time again.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/10_tips_successful_woocommerce_site.jpg"><figcaption>Jack Rudy Cocktail Co.'s gorgeous and easy-to-use site runs WooCommerce.</figcaption></figure><h2>1) Use Great Photos<br></h2><p>Getting great pictures of your products are an important step towards getting your customers to browse through, and eventually buy from your store. Source good shots, or arrange to have appealing photographs of your products taken so that users can see the details and finish of your products, and if possible, see them in action too.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Aether_apparel_uses_great_product_and_action_photos.jpg"><figcaption>Aether Apparel uses great product and action photos</figcaption></figure><p>If a user visits a product page, they definitely want to see the item, so show it to them. Use large images on product pages, and include shots from multiple angles. Implement a lightbox plugin that allows users to zoom in on individual images and cycle through multiple images so they're in complete control.</p><p>If you're arranging to have your products shot, ensure that they are photographed with a consistent style, setting and lighting conditions. This will allow customers to compare products on your site easily and accurately decide what they like best.<br></p><h2>2) Great Copy Goes a Long Way<br></h2><p>An online store isn't just a collection of products and a checkout page: it's also a showcase for your unique brand, and that's what customers will be able to connect with. Use copy with a consistent tone of voice to tell your brand's story and show off your personality—on your About page, in your product descriptions and in complementary content like your blog and help pages.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Jack_Rudy_Cocktail_Co_tells_a_great_story.jpg"><figcaption>Jack Rudy Cocktail Co. tells a great story on their About page</figcaption></figure><p>When writing about products, be sufficiently descriptive and skip the hyperbole. Focus on helping customers understand whether the product is a good choice for them—mention use cases and address potential questions that buyers may have: <i>is that jacket waterproof? How long do the batteries in this Bluetooth speaker last? Is this preserve good for more than just toast?</i><br></p><h2>3) Create Useful Content<br></h2><p>As an online business catering to your specific market, you and your company have a unique experience to share. From the processes you've set up to ensure the best quality products, to engaging with customers to learn about their needs, everything you go through in setting up and running your store can form the foundation of your brand blog. From there, you can build upon your blog content by talking about what your brand stands for, what your customers are into and how they can get most out of your products.</p><p>Home Depot's <a href="http://ext.homedepot.com/community/blog/" rel="external" target="_blank">The Apron Blog</a>&nbsp;does a terrific job of keeping customers engaged—the home improvement and construction products store regularly posts DIY projects around the home, trends in interior design, and ideas for decorating rooms and gardens. By inspiring homeowners to do more with the space they have through this blog, Home Depot creates a deeper connection with their customers, even when they're not actively making purchases.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Home_Depot_does_a_great_job_of_engaging_customers_with_their_blog.jpg"><figcaption>Home Depot does a great job of engaging customers with their blog</figcaption></figure><h2>4) Reach Out Regularly With a Newsletter<br></h2><p>Email newsletters have been around for ages, and they're still a favorite mode of communication among marketers who want to reach customers with news about products, offers and events.</p><p>Email marketing is a great way to privately share useful information with customers who are interested in your brand, with the added benefit of being able to track the response from your audience—when they choose to unsubscribe, which links they click on, and how often your emails are forwarded.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Create_engaging_and_relevant_email_newsletters_for_best_results.jpg"><figcaption>Create engaging and relevant email newsletters to tell customers about new products and offers</figcaption></figure><p>The more you target and personalize these mailers based on users' habits and purchase history, the higher the returns. <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/designing-an-email-campaign-think-like-a-marketer--webdesign-6698" rel="external" target="_blank">Follow these practices</a> when sending out newsletters&nbsp;for the best results.<br></p><h2>5) Include And Involve Users<br></h2><p>Today's shoppers are vocal, and want to share their experiences with the products they buy—and that's a wonderful opportunity for your store to capitalize on. Allow users to submit reviews and ratings of your products to let others know what they liked and what they didn't. These reviews will also give you insights into what customers are interested in and what's important to them. Reviews often help increase product conversions; ecommerce experts Bazaarvoice found that <a href="http://www.bazaarvoice.com/industries/Ratings-and-Reviews-increase-conversion-rates-on-figleavescom-UK.html" rel="external" target="_blank">conversions increased by as much as 12.5%</a> in a study they ran on innerwear retailer figleaves.com. And all you have to do to make this happen is enable a setting in WooCommerce.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Amazon_knows_the_power_of_customer_reviews_for_aiding_conversion.jpg"><figcaption>Amazon knows the power of customer reviews to encourage conversion</figcaption></figure><p>You can take things further by offering discounts for reviews. In the same Bazaarvoice research, products with over 20 reviews had a 83.85% higher conversion rate than those that have no reviews. By offering discounts, you create an incentive for customers to shop in the future, and their reviews help lend credibility to your store.&nbsp;</p><p>There's <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/review-for-discount/" rel="external" target="_blank">a great WooCommerce extension</a> that lets you do just that.&nbsp;And it certainly doesn't hurt that reviews do wonders for your SEO—each new review serves as fresh content for search engine indexers to find and highlight when people are looking for what you have to sell.</p><p>Don't be afraid of negative product reviews—these offer you a chance to flex your customer support muscle. Address these issues by engaging with customers as best as you can, whether that means a personal phone call, a refund or a replacement.<br></p><p>According to a study, <a href="http://blog.bazaarvoice.com/2006/04/10/63-customers-more-likely-to-buy-on-sites-with-reviews/" rel="external" target="_blank">63% of online shoppers say they are more likely to buy on sites with positive reviews</a>. If you've got customers who love your business and shop with you often, contact them personally and encourage them to write you a testimonial.&nbsp;</p><p>WooThemes offers <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/testimonials-by-woothemes/" rel="external" target="_blank">a great free plugin</a> that lets you showcase testimonials from your patrons with custom styling to incorporate easily with your site template.</p><h2>6) Increase Visibility With SEO<br></h2><p>As an online business, it's imperative to ensure that your site and products can be found easily by users on search engines. Taking a few steps towards optimizing your site content for search engines to properly index your store will help improve your ranking on search results and bring in more visitors.&nbsp;<br></p><p>One of the best things you can do is use a comprehensive SEO plugin like <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" rel="external" target="_blank">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a>, which allows you to easily add meta descriptions, keywords, optimized permalinks and more to ensure that search engines know where your content is, and what it's about. Oh, and it's free!</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Use_an_SEO_plugin_to_improve_your_site_ranking.jpg"><figcaption>Use an SEO plugin to improve your site ranking in search results</figcaption></figure><h2>7) Offer a Helping Hand<br></h2><p>Customer support is a crucial part of running an online store. It's not only about handling problems with shipping and refund, but also about helping customers find products they want and making them feel comfortable shopping on your site.&nbsp;</p><p>The easiest way to get started is to answer the most common questions shoppers usually have, such as those concerning shipping policies and pricing, returns and guarantees. Write these up on an FAQ page and encourage customers to contact you with any queries they might have, using a contact form.</p><p>You can also assist shoppers with live chat. <a href="http://www.olark.com/" target="_self">Olark's&nbsp;incredible support service</a> adds a discreet tab to the bottom of your site window that lets customers ping you when you're available to ask questions. Plus, it shows you which page a customer is browsing through, allows you to save chat transcripts, and generates detailed analytics and reports to give you a better overview of your customers' support needs. Olark is easy to install on any WooCommerce site, is very reasonably priced and you can even try it out for free.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Engage_customers_with_live_chat_to_help_or_suggest_products.jpg"><figcaption>Engage customers with live chat to help them shop, or suggest suitable products</figcaption></figure><h2>8) Enable Power Shoppers to do More<br></h2><p>So you've got great products and happy shoppers, and business is humming along. The next step is to get customers into the habit of shopping with you regularly, by making it easy and fun to do so. There are a couple of things you can do to get started:</p><h3><b>Wishlists</b></h3><p>Sometimes customers might visit your store just to browse or compare products to purchase later. Or, they might want to create a personal registry for others to easily find the right gifts for them.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Allow_users_to_create_and_share_wishlists.jpg"><figcaption>Allow users to create and share wishlists so they can easily resume shopping whenever they want</figcaption></figure><p>The nifty <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-wishlists/" rel="external" target="_blank">WooCommerce Wishlists extension</a> allows them to do all that and more, and lets you fine-tune the functionality to suit your store and audience best. With Wishlists, you don't have to turn customers away if they don't want to buy something just then—and you'll have a reason for them to come back.</p><h3>Vouchers, Coupons and Store Credit<br></h3><p>Granting users flexibility over how they choose to spend money at your store puts more power in their hands, and more transactions on your balance sheet. Here are a few ways to do that:</p><ul><li>Instead of only allowing purchases, consider offering gift vouchers that customers can present to their loved ones—great for when someone can't decide on the perfect gift.</li><li>Discounts are great for getting both new and existing customers in the door and through to the checkout page. Create offers, market them through social media and newsletters, and watch your sales go through the roof.</li><li>Putting a store credit system in place allows customers to shop at leisure and makes the purchase process even smoother than your existing checkout system. It also allows shoppers to stick to a budget, and by helping them do that, you build trust and win the confidence of your clientele.</li></ul><p>The <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/smart-coupons/" rel="external" target="_blank">Smart Coupons extension for WooCommerce </a>enables all this functionality and more, with total control over how you choose to implement it in your store. Whether you want to create special seasonal, holiday and event-based sales, or draw in new customers by marketing your offers on a deals listing site, this plugin makes it easy.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Discounts_are_a_great_way_to_entice_new_and_existing_customers.jpg"><figcaption>Discounts are a great way to entice new and existing customers</figcaption></figure><h2>A word about&nbsp;housekeeping<br></h2><p>Running a tight ship on your site backend is just as important as keeping your accounts in order or properly managing your inventory. While WooCommerce already helps you take care of those essential processes, here are a couple more things you should handle to ensure that your site runs quickly and without issues.</p><h3>9) Use a CDN For Speedy Performance<br></h3><p>CDNs or Content Delivery Networks are services that you can plug your site into, to take on the task of delivering heavy files like images and CSS sheets from a server optimized for speed and geographically closest to your users—and drastically reducing page load times in the process. Quicker sites reduce bounce rates, increase customer satisfaction, and also help sites rank better on Google search results. Choose a well-known and reliable CDN like <a href="http://www.maxcdn.com" rel="external" target="_blank">MaxCDN</a>, who offer quick and simple setup processes and competitive pricing.</p><h3>10) Backup Your Site<br></h3><p>Whether your site faces a hacker attack, needs to be migrated to different server or web host, requires upgrades or even changes to the theme, it's always a good idea to have a recent backup of all your files, content and databases so that you can restore order at a moment's notice.&nbsp;</p><p>Go with a quality backup service like <a href="http://vaultpress.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">VaultPress</a>&nbsp;to make sure your site is safe at all times. This top-of-the-line service from <a href="http://automattic.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">the folks who built Wordpress</a> features real-time backups, automated restorations and a full backup archive and offers an optional security scanning functionality for additional protection.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/284/posts/21453/image/Backup_your_site_and_databases_regularly.jpg"><figcaption>Backup your site and databases regularly to avoid downtime</figcaption></figure><h2>Conclusion<br></h2><p>Running a successful online store takes a lot of work, right from stocking quality products to bringing in customers and keeping them interested over time.

however, the child as the ability to introduce it's own attributes.<br></blockquote><p>It's a bit less formal than what you may find in an academic book, or even on Wikipedia, but it still explains the idea in terms that illustrate the point.</p><p>In this article, we'll review all of the necessary code, functions, and reserved words related to the topic,&nbsp;we're going to take a look at how we can implement it within PHP in a very, very simple platform-agnostic way,&nbsp;&nbsp;and then we'll review an actual implementation of where inheritance is at play within WordPress.</p><p>So with that set as our roadmap for the article, let's go ahead and get started.</p><h2>PHP Facilities</h2><p>In order to implement inheritance in object-oriented PHP, there are a number of reserved words with which we need to familiarize ourselves. Luckily, most of the words we've already covered, and those that we haven't are clear enough such that it's easy to remember them.</p><p>So before we dive into looking at code, let's take a look at all of the reserved words in the language that we need to know so that we can begin to actually get into creating something.</p><ul><li><code class="inline">extends</code> is reserved word that indicates that one class is the child of another class. For example, in our previous article, a <code class="inline">Post</code> extends <code class="inline">Content</code>. We'll see this in play soon.</li><li><code class="inline">private</code> is an attribute that is applied to properties and functions that mean they are accessible&nbsp;<i>only</i> within the context of the class in which they are defined.</li><li><code class="inline">protected</code> is similar to <code class="inline">private</code> with the exception that the properties and methods that are marked as such can be accessed by the given class and any child classes.</li><li><code class="inline">public</code> is the opposite of <code class="inline">private</code> in that it means any class - the given class, a subclass, or a third-party class - can access the property or method in order to change it's information or call the function.</li></ul><p>You also need to be familiar with the <code class="inline">::</code> operator, but we'll cover that a little bit later in the article when we begin looking at code.</p><p>And that's it - nothing terribly daunting, is it? And what's even better is that if you've been following along with us throughout this series, then you're likely familiar with every word save for <code class="inline">extends</code>.</p><p>Anyway, with that said, let's start working on an example.</p><h2>Some Example Code</h2><p>In order to get started writing some example code, we need to lay out exactly what it is that we're going to be trying to model (after all, that's what code does, isn't it?).&nbsp;</p><p>In keeping consistent with the theme used throughout this series - especially in the last article - we'll have a parent class called <code class="inline">Content</code>, and two child classes each of which will be named <code class="inline">Comment</code> and <code class="inline">Post</code>, respectively.</p><p>This will allow us to see how properties and methods exist within a single class, and how children can access attributes of their parents, as well as how parents can protect their properties and functions from their children, as well.</p><p>But implementation will demonstrate far more than talking about it, so let's started writing some code.</p><h3>The Parent Class</h3><p>In our example, the parent class is going to be the <code class="inline">Content</code> because both of the subclasses - that is, the <code class="inline">Post</code> and the <code class="inline">Comment</code> - are types of content that have unique information associated with them that is not specific to the <code class="inline">Content</code> class.</p><p>The key to inheritance is to identify all of the properties and methods that are common across all of the classes and keep them defined in the parent class or, in our class, in <code class="inline">Content</code>.</p><p>Though this can vary based on how you view this, we'll setup <code class="inline">Content</code>&nbsp;such that it includes:</p><ul><li>a date on which the content was published</li><li>an author&nbsp;</li><li>a method for saving the content</li><li>a method for formatting the content</li><li>a method for retrieving the content</li><li>and a method for retrieving the content author&nbsp;</li></ul><p>First, we'll look at the code, then we'll explain everything that's going on with it.</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;?php

class Content {

    protected $publish_date;

	protected $author;

	private $content;

	public function __construct() {

		date_default_timezone_set( 'GMT' );
		$date = new DateTime();

		$this-&gt;publish_date = $date-&gt;format( 'Y-m-d H:i:s' );
		$this-&gt;author = '';

	}

	public function save( $author, $content ) {

		$this-&gt;author = $author;
		$this-&gt;content = $this-&gt;format_content( $content );
		$this-&gt;content;

	}

	public function read() {
		return $this-&gt;content;
	}

	private function format_content( $content ) {
		return strip_tags( stripslashes( $content ) );
	}

	public function get_author() {
		return $this-&gt;author;
	}

}</pre><p>As previously mentioned, we have two <code class="inline">protected</code> attributes and a <code class="inline">private</code> attribute. Recall that this means that all of the subclasses can access the <code class="inline">$publish_date</code> and the <code class="inline">$author</code>, but&nbsp;<i>only</i> the <code class="inline">Content</code> can access the <code class="inline">$content</code> attribute.</p><p>Also note that much of the code that you see in the above class is basic object-oriented PHP. There's nothing that stands out that deals directly with inheritance other than some of the access modifiers that we've declared. That is to say that it's relatively common to code we've seen thus far in this tutorial.</p><p>One of the things that's worth noting is that the private function is in place to demonstrate two things:</p><ol><li>How <code class="inline">private</code> functions are only accessible within the context of the class in which its defined.</li><li>Strips any tags and slashes from the content so that markup cannot be saved with the content.</li></ol><p>Of course, this code isn't connected a database or a file system or anything, but the point still remains.</p><p>Note that, in the code above there are a couple of things that we've needed to add in order to satisfy PHP's requirements. They are beyond the scope of this article, but it's worth pointing out here:</p><ul><li>The code to <code class="inline">date_default_time_set</code> is required to set the timezone off of which the time can be retrieved.</li><li>The constructor is responsible for initially setting the publish date of the content, and it initializes the author property to an empty string. This is so that a <code class="inline">Post</code> can have its own author and the <code class="inline">Comment</code> can have its own author, as well. As we'll see later, a <code class="inline">Comment</code> can even override the default publish date.</li></ul><p>Note also that we're able to retrieve the content from the <code class="inline">read</code> method and we're able to get the author from the <code class="inline">get_author</code> function.</p><h3>The First Child</h3><p>Next, let's go ahead and create the <code class="inline">Post</code> subclass. First, we'll take a look at the code and then we'll see how it interacts with the <code class="inline">Content</code> class we just created.</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;?php

class Post extends Content {

    public function __construct() {

        parent::__construct();
        $this-&gt;author = 'Tom McFarlin';

    }

    public function post( $content ) {
        $this-&gt;format_content( $content );
    }

}</pre><p>The class appears small, right? There are no properties - because it inherits them from the <code class="inline">Content</code> class - and there are only two functions, one of which is unique to the class - <code class="inline">post</code>.<br></p><p>Notice that in the constructor, we first make a call to the parent constructor using the <code class="inline">::</code> operator. You can read much more about this <a href="http://www.php.net//manual/en/language.oop5.paamayim-nekudotayim.php" rel="external" target="_blank">in the manual</a>, but suffice it to say that the operator is reserved to reference a number of difference things outside of the class in which it is defined. In our case, that's the call to the parent's constructor.</p><p>Next, I've opted to set my name as the author of the post. Notice that I'm using the <code class="inline">$this</code> keyword. Because the subclass inherits properties from its parent, it can refer to those properties and if they were defined within itself.</p><p>Note that this is possible not just because <code class="inline">Post extends Content</code> but because the property is marked as <code class="inline">protected</code> in <code class="inline">Content</code>, as well. If it were marked as <code class="inline">private</code>, this would not be possible.</p><h3>The Second Child</h3><p>Now that we've created the <code class="inline">Post</code> class, we also have the <code class="inline">Comment</code> class which, recall, represents someone leaving a a comment on a post. Were this production-level code, there would be far more code: We would need to relate a comment to a post, determine if a comment is a reply to an existing comment, mark a status of a comment, and so on.</p><p>But for the purposes of demonstrating&nbsp;<i>inheritance</i>, we're leaving all of that out and focusing only on the things that can drive the concepts.</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;?php

class Comment extends Content {

    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function add( $comment ) {
        $this-&gt;save( 'John Doe', $comment );
    }

}</pre><p>As you can see, the <code class="inline">Comment</code> code isn't much different from the <code class="inline">Post</code> code. To a degree - this is good because it shows that we've abstracted the proper parts into our base class.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, notice that after we construct the <code class="inline">Comment</code>, we make our call to the parent constructor.&nbsp;Next, we define the <code class="inline">add</code> method which is responsible for taking the incoming comment and then saving it by passing the comment author and it's content to the <code class="inline">save</code> method.</p><p>The nice thing is that the <code class="inline">save</code> method is already defined within the base class which also handles all of the formatting through the use of a <code class="inline">private</code> function, so we gain that functionality as we create our child class.</p><h2>Working with The Example</h2><p>With that done, let's run a couple of examples to show how the pieces fit together. To make sure this code executes, all you need is a web server, a directory out of which to run PHP scripts, and a text editor.</p><p>First, we'll create an instance of <code class="inline">Content</code> and then we'll call a debug statement so that we can see what constitutes an instance of the class.</p><pre class="brush: php">$content = new Content();
var_dump( $content );</pre><p>Permitting all works correctly, you should see everything that's above.</p><p>Next up, let's go ahead and create a post. Since we're setting all of the information in the context of the class, all we really need to do is call a function on the class in order to display the information.</p><p>For example:</p><pre class="brush: php">$post = new Post();
echo 'The post author is: ' . $post-&gt;get_author();</pre><p>Again, since we've set everything up in the code itself, simply calling the method demonstrates the concept.</p><p>Finally, we can create a <code class="inline">Comment</code>, call the <code class="inline">add</code> method on an instance of the class, attempt to pass in malicious code (only to see it stripped out by our code). If everything goes well, you should see the following:</p><pre class="brush: php">$comment = new Comment();
$comment-&gt;add( '&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;alert("This is my comment.");&lt;/script&gt;' );
echo 'The comment reads: ' . $comment-&gt;read();</pre><p>And that's it: Our simple demonstration of inheritance.</p><h2>Inheritance in WordPress</h2><p>When it comes to looking at inheritance in WordPress, the very first thing that comes to mind for myself - and likely other developers - is the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API" rel="external" target="_blank">Widgets API</a>. The reason I say this is because the API is powered by inheritance.</p><p>Sure, widgets can be created without using the API, but I'd argue that's a misstep in development. Why make things more complicated for yourself when there's already a foundation in place to do it? But I digress.</p><p>The nice thing about this particular API is that it showcases all of the high-points of object-oriented programming and inheritance at work. For example, here's a piece of sample code taken directly from the Codex:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;?php

class My_Widget extends WP_Widget {

        /**
         * Sets up the widgets name etc
         */
	public function __construct() {
		// widget actual processes
	}

	/**
	 * Outputs the content of the widget
	 *
	 * @param array $args
	 * @param array $instance
	 */
	public function widget( $args, $instance ) {
		// outputs the content of the widget
	}

	/**
	 * Outputs the options form on admin
	 *
	 * @param array $instance The widget options
	 */
	public function form( $instance ) {
		// outputs the options form on admin
	}

	/**
	 * Processing widget options on save
	 *
	 * @param array $new_instance The new options
	 * @param array $old_instance The previous options
	 */
	public function update( $new_instance, $old_instance ) {
		// processes widget options to be saved
	}
}</pre><p>Now that we've covered the conceptual model, looked at the keywords and methodology, written our own code, and created our own example, this should be relatively easy to follow.</p><p>But here's the thing: One of the best ways to get better at writing any type of code is to continually practice the concepts. That is, to explore the ideas written by other people who have done more advanced things that you in prior work.</p><p>Case in point, take a look at <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API#Example" rel="external" target="_blank">the first example</a> provided in the WordPress Codex. And if you're working with a later version of PHP that supports features such as namespaces (a slightly more advanced topic), then check out <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API#Example_With_Namespaces" rel="external" target="_blank">the second example</a>, as well.</p><p>The more you review the code and tease it apart, the more you are to learn about it. But going any further than that in this article will take us out of scope of the entire series.</p><h2>To The End</h2><p>At this point, we've covered all of the beginner material necessary to lay the foundation for a beginner's guide to writing object-oriented PHP. In the final article, we'll provide a summary of everything we've covered so that we have a single reference for the big ideas that can be bookmarked, saved, or referred to later.</p><p>Additionally, we'll have a short period of discussion on a follow-up series, but we'll save that until then.</p><p>For now, if you have any questions, comments, and/or feedback on the content, code, or examples above, feel free to do so in the comment section below.</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21457/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21457/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21457/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21457/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-19T15:00:53.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-19T15:00:53.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"
