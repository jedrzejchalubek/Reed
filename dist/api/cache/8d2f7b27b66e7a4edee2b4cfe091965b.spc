It falls somewhere in between the typical realms of static and dynamic websites, whereby the process of creating and editing sites comes down to three essential stages:</p><ol><li>Create a static site written in regular HTML / CSS / JS and add it to your&nbsp;Cloud Cannon folder in Dropbox.</li><li>Define the editable areas of the site by adding&nbsp;<code class="inline">class="editable"</code>, and duplicable areas by adding&nbsp;<code class="inline">class="repeatables"</code>.</li><li>Give your client access, and they will be able to&nbsp;directly&nbsp;edit the site through their&nbsp;browser.</li></ol><p>I tried out a quick test of the process and it all works exactly as advertised. I was able to sign up, create a site and upload a template I got from <a href="http://graphicburger.com/myjourney-psdhtml-template/" target="_self">Graphic Burger</a> in about a minute flat.&nbsp;I then opened up the <b>index.html</b> file in Sublime Text and added an&nbsp;<code class="inline">editable</code> class to the template's main heading.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/30/posts/21231/image/addeditable-2.png"></figure><p>After saving, I&nbsp;allowed a second for Dropbox to sync the file, then opened the same file in the Cloud Cannon editor.

It is best suited to creating static websites and supports fully custom templates written in HTML, using template tags like&nbsp;<code class="inline">{{Body}}</code> to place content.</p><p>Adding content to your site is a simple matter of placing <code class="inline">.txt</code> files containing Markdown or HTML&nbsp;in a folder named "Content".

In your site's "templates" folder in Dropbox are three template files,&nbsp;<b>index.html</b>,&nbsp;<b>post.html</b> and&nbsp;<b>archive.html</b>. These files are made up of basic HTML in combination with <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">Jinja</a> syntax template tags.&nbsp;</p><p>To use your own theme create your design as regular HTML then integrate the appropriate template tags, such as&nbsp;<code class="inline">{{ site.title }}</code> to display your site's title for example. A full reference of Markbox's template tags can be found on their <a href="https://app.markbox.io/dash/templates" target="_self">template design page</a>.</p><p>Setup of a Markbox blog was very quick and easy, and rewarded me with a picture of a cat which is always deserving of bonus points:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/53/posts/21231/image/markbox.jpg"></figure><ul><li><b>Demo:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://tutsplusdemo.markbox.io/">http://tutsplusdemo.markbox.io/</a></li><li><b>Pricing:</b> <a href="http://www.markbox.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Markbox</a> is free for the first thirty days, after which it is $6 per month.</li></ul><h2>Honorable Mentions:<b></b></h2><h3>Site44</h3><p><a href="http://www.site44.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Site44</a> looks like an appealing platform, however it requires a credit card to commence the 30 day trial which I wasn't willing to provide&nbsp;for my purely&nbsp;investigatory purposes. It is essentially a straight web hosting platform via Dropbox, so rather than parsing Markdown files it displays whatever static files you have in your Site44 Dropbox folder. It also lets you setup simple password protection, custom 404 pages, MIME type control and redirects.</p><h3>Sellbox</h3><p><a href="https://sellboxhq.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Sellbox</a> isn't a site creation platform, but it is a very intriguing Dropbox-powered simple eCommerce platform. You add the files you wish to sell, e.g games, themes, ebooks and so on&nbsp;to a Sellbox folder in your Dropbox account. Sellbox then provides you with a link you can share, and when people click it they send you money via PayPal or Bitcoin and are given access to download the file</p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>With site building platforms aimed at everyone from personal bloggers to professional web designers, and prices ranging from completely free up to full enterprise solutions, there's a Dropbox powered system&nbsp;out there to suit just about everyone.</p><p>Try out a Dropbox-powered platform for your sites&nbsp;and you might just find your hosting bill gets slashed while your speed and&nbsp;performance rockets!</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21231/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21231/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21231/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21231/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T18:00:34.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T18:00:34.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<h2>Advanced Custom Fields</h2>
<p>Creating custom fields for a post type is time consuming, and weâve identified key security considerations in the process.  For a CRM, where we may have several, different field types such as a select dropdown or checkboxes, manually creating fields in a plugin would take a significant amount of time.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> is a WordPress plugin that provides both a user interface and programmatic methods for creating custom meta boxes and custom fields on any post type.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;It also provides a greater range of form field types, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>visual editors</li>
<li>number / range</li>
<li>password</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>image</li>
<li>select</li>
<li>checkbox</li>
<li>post objects</li>
<li>Google Maps</li>
</ul>
<p>Custom meta boxes and their fields can have conditions attached to them, so they are only displayed based on the post type or value of another field.  This is really useful if we only want to display a field when a checkbox is checked, for example.</p>
<h2>Installing Advanced Custom Fields</h2>
<p>Go to the <i>Plugins &gt; Add New</i> in your WordPress dashboard.  In the search box, enter <i>Advanced Custom Fields</i>, and click <i>Search Plugins</i>:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-search.png"></figure>
<p>In the search results screen, find <i>Advanced Custom Fields</i>, and click <i>Install Now</i>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-install.png"></figure>
<p>Once installed, activate the plugin.</p>
<h2>Removing Our Custom Field</h2>
<p>As weâll be using Advanced Custom Fields to generate our custom meta boxes and fields, the quickest way to remove our Custom Field generated in the second part of this series is to <a>download the code from Part 1</a> of this tutorial series.</p>
<h2>Wait, What Was Part 2 All About?</h2>
<p>Rather than just jump straight into using Advanced Custom Fields, we explained in detail how the process works for registering custom meta boxes, custom fields, saving data and retrieving data.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;By doing this, we have a clearer idea as to how Advanced Custom Fields works, as well as seeing how much faster it is (not to mention a better user interface).</p>
<h2>Creating a Field Group</h2>
<p>Click on <i>Custom Fields</i> in the WordPress Administration menu:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-menu.png"></figure>
<p>You will see the <i>Field Groups</i> screen. Think of a field group as a custom meta box that we described in Part 2.  Letâs create our first field group, by clicking <i>Add New</i> next to the field group title:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-field-groups-add.png"></figure>
<p>Call the field group <i>Contact Details</i>, and then click on the <i>Add Field</i> button to add our first field:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-add-new-field-group-1.png"></figure>
<p>Enter in the following details:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Field Label</td>
<td>Email Address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Field Type</td>
<td>Email</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Required?</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Scroll down to the <i>Location</i> box. We want this field group to only display on our <i>Contact</i>&nbsp;custom post type, so letâs add a condition by choosing <i>Show this field group if Post Type is equal to contact</i>:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-add-new-field-group-2.png"></figure>
<p>Scroll down to the options box. Set the <i>Order No.</i> to <i>1</i>, <i>Style</i> to <i>Standard</i> and check all boxes for <i>Hide on screen</i>, except the <i>Content Editor</i> option:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-add-new-field-group-3.png"></figure>
<p>Click <i>Publish</i>, and the Field Group will be saved.</p>
<p>Letâs check our field is available on our Contact Post Type, by going to <i>Contacts &gt; Add New</i> in the WordPress dashboard:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-contact.png"></figure>
<p>Go ahead and enter a name and email address for your Contact, and click <i>Publish</i>.  Youâll see how Advanced Custom Fields handles all field validation, saving, and reading custom field data.</p>
<p>Letâs add some more fields to our existing <i>Field Group</i>. Edit the <i>Contact Details </i>field group you created above, and add the following fields:</p>
<table>
<caption>Phone Number</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Field Label</td>
<td>Phone Number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Field Type</td>
<td>Number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Required?</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<caption>Photo</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Field Label</td>
<td>Photo</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Field Type</td>
<td>Image</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Required?</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<caption>Type</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Field Label</td>
<td>Type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Field Type</td>
<td>Select</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Required?</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Choices</td>
<td>
Prospect : Prospect<br>
Customer : Customer
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Feel free to add any other fields or information youâd normally store for your customers and prospects.</p>
<p>When youâre done, click <i>Update</i>, and start adding, editing, and managing your Contacts:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-contacts.png"></figure>
<h2>Prevent Custom Field Changes</h2>
<p>We donât want other WordPress administrators changing these fields (or worse, deleting them), as it would mean we canât view or edit a Contactâs information.</p>
<p>Open the plugin file we created earlier, and add the following before <code>class WPTutsCRM {</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: php">define( 'ACF_LITE', true );</pre>
<p>Save the plugin file and reload the WordPress Administration interface.  Youâll see that the <i>Custom Fields</i> menu entry has disappeared:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-custom-fields-hidden.png"></figure>
<h2>Programmatically Define Custom Fields</h2>
<p>We could go a step further and programmatically define our custom fields, instead of relying on the user interface of the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to define them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;This would be useful if, for example, we were to distribute our CRM plugin to multiple WordPress installations.  It would be time consuming to:</p>
<ul>
<li>install the CRM plugin,</li>
<li>install Advanced Custom Fields</li>
<li>define our field groups and custom fields</li>
</ul>
<p>Remove the following code from our plugin, so we can access it again through the WordPress administration:</p>
<pre class="brush: php">define( 'ACF_LITE', true );</pre>
<p>In the WordPress Administration, click on <i>Custom Fields</i>, and then click the <i>Export</i> option.</p>
<p>From here, letâs select the <i>Contact Details</i> group and click the <i>Export to PHP</i> option:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-export.png"></figure>
<p>Single-click the code which appears on screen, which will highlight it all.  Copy this to your clipboard, and paste it inside a new function within your Plugin:</p>
<pre class="brush: php">/**
* Register ACF Field Groups and Fields
*/
function acf_fields() {

	if( function_exists( "register_field_group" ) ) {
		register_field_group(array (
			'id' =&gt; 'acf_contact-details',
			'title' =&gt; 'Contact Details',
			'fields' =&gt; array (
				array (
					'key' =&gt; 'field_5323276db7e18',
					'label' =&gt; 'Email Address',
					'name' =&gt; 'email_address',
					'type' =&gt; 'email',
					'required' =&gt; 1,
					'default_value' =&gt; '',
					'placeholder' =&gt; '',
					'prepend' =&gt; '',
					'append' =&gt; '',
				),
				array (
					'key' =&gt; 'field_53232a6cf3800',
					'label' =&gt; 'Phone Number',
					'name' =&gt; 'phone_number',
					'type' =&gt; 'number',
					'default_value' =&gt; '',
					'placeholder' =&gt; '',
					'prepend' =&gt; '',

					'step' =&gt; '',
				),
				array (
					'key' =&gt; 'field_53232aa9f3801',
					'label' =&gt; 'Photo',
					'name' =&gt; 'photo',
					'type' =&gt; 'image',
					'save_format' =&gt; 'object',
					'preview_size' =&gt; 'thumbnail',
					'library' =&gt; 'all',
				),
				array (
					'key' =&gt; 'field_53232c2ff3802',
					'label' =&gt; 'Type',
					'name' =&gt; 'type',
					'type' =&gt; 'select',
					'required' =&gt; 1,
					'choices' =&gt; array (
						'Prospect' =&gt; 'Prospect',
						'Customer' =&gt; 'Customer',
					),
					'default_value' =&gt; '',
					'allow_null' =&gt; 0,
					'multiple' =&gt; 0,
				),
			),
			'location' =&gt; array (
				array (
					array (
						'param' =&gt; 'post_type',
						'operator' =&gt; '==',
						'value' =&gt; 'contact',
						'order_no' =&gt; 0,
						'group_no' =&gt; 0,
					),
				),
			),
			'options' =&gt; array (
				'position' =&gt; 'normal',
				'layout' =&gt; 'default',
				'hide_on_screen' =&gt; array (
					0 =&gt; 'permalink',
					1 =&gt; 'excerpt',
					2 =&gt; 'custom_fields',
					3 =&gt; 'discussion',
					4 =&gt; 'comments',
					5 =&gt; 'revisions',
					6 =&gt; 'slug',
					7 =&gt; 'author',
					8 =&gt; 'format',

					10 =&gt; 'categories',
					11 =&gt; 'tags',
					12 =&gt; 'send-trackbacks',
				),
			),
			'menu_order' =&gt; 1,
		));
	}
}
</pre>
<p>Next, deactivate the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin, and then move the <code>advanced-custom-fields</code> plugin folder into our <code>tuts-crm</code> folder:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/201/posts/20049/image/acf-move.png"></figure>
<p>By moving Advanced Custom Fields outside of the Plugins directory, weâll need to manually activate it from within our Plugin.  Letâs do that by adding the following code before <code>class WPTutsCRM {</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: php">include_once( 'advanced-custom-fields/acf.php' );
define( 'ACF_LITE', true );</pre>
<p>Finally, we need to tell Advanced Custom Fields that we have programmatically defined field groups and Custom Fields.  Change our pluginâs construct to the below:</p>
<pre class="brush: php">/**
* Constructor. Called when plugin is initialised
*/
function WPTutsCRM() {

	add_action( 'init', array( $this, 'register_custom_post_type' ) );
	add_action( 'plugins_loaded', array( $this, 'acf_fields' ) );
    
}</pre>
<p>Reload the WordPress dashboard, and create and/or edit a Contact.  Youâll see that our field groups and custom fields remain in place.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<p>Bundling a plugin within a plugin isnât always the best approach.  While it allows us to distribute our plugin quickly across multiple WordPress installations in a single step, weâd need to issue an update to our plugin each time:</p>
<ul>
<li>fields are created, edited or destroyed</li>
<li>Advanced Custom Fields has an update available</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your use case, you may prefer this bundled approach.  If youâre running this on a single site, using the user interface to define your Field Groups and Custom Fields may be a quicker, easier approach.</p>

As we wrap up this series, we're going to take a look at how to setup Bower for your next project. Specifically, we're going to cover how to install, update, and customize various components using Bower.</p><p>In previous posts, I talked about what <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> is and how it can help you with you WordPress development. In this post, I am going to walk you through how to setup Bower for your project and some advanced techniques with it as well.</p><p>Some of the concepts are similar to <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, so I would suggest taking a look at a previous post, <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/setting-up-grunt-for-your-next-project--wp-35123">Setting Up Grunt For Your Next Project</a>. We are finally getting into some code. Let's do this!</p><h2><b>bower.json</b></h2><p>The key to Bower in a project is the <code class="inline">bower.json</code> file. This is what will be parsed during a <code class="inline">bower install</code> for you and any consumer of your project. It is also necessary in order to save dependencies, but more on that later.</p><p>The first thing that we are going to do is create a <code class="inline">bower.json</code> file in the project's root folder. I would suggest starting with at least the name, description, and version.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what we will start with:</p><pre class="brush: javascript">{
    "name": "tuts-bower",
    "description": "Example project for tutorial on Bower for Tuts+",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}</pre><h2><b>Installing Dependencies</b></h2><p>Now that we have a <code class="inline">bower.json</code> file, let's add Bootstrap to our project. We are going to do this by going to the command line and typing in <code class="inline">bower install bootstrap-sass-official --save</code>. This should create a <code class="inline">bower_components</code> folder with a <code class="inline">bootstrap-sass-official</code> folder inside it, along with updating our <code class="inline">bower.json</code> file.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what it should look like now:</p><pre class="brush: javascript">{
  "name": "tuts-bower",
  "description": "Example project for tutorial on Bower for Tuts+",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap-sass-official": "~3.1.1"
  }
}</pre><p>You will notice dependencies is added and there is <code class="inline">bootstrap-sass-official</code> along with the latest version number.</p><h2><b>Updating Components</b></h2><p>One of my favorite features of Bower is how simple it is to update the components I use in a project. For those who know me, I am usually one to try out the latest version of whatever libraries I'm currently using. As soon at a new release of Bootstrap comes out, I'm pulling it into a project. Bower makes it really easy to do this.</p><p>In our above example, the tilde "~" in front of the version number simply means to use at least this version. It will also update your project to any new patch release when you run <code class="inline">bower update</code>. For example, when/if Bootstrap updates to 3.1.2, you can simply run <code class="inline">bower update</code> and you will get updated to that version.</p><p>There's a number of different ways that you can specify what versions of each component to use.</p><ul>
<li>Explicit version - <code class="inline">3.1.1</code></li>
<li>Only patch versions -&nbsp;<code class="inline">~3.1.1</code></li>
<li>Minor versions - <code class="inline">^3.1.1</code></li>
<li>Latest version - <code class="inline">*</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver/#ranges">The whole list</a></li>
</ul><h2><b>Using Components</b></h2><p>Now that we have Bootstrap installed, let's get it built into our project. For the example in this post I am only going to add the styles to the project, not the JavaScript or Fonts. I do include these in the full project on GitHub.</p><p>The first thing we are going to want to do is create a <code class="inline">style.scss</code> file that we will compile into our style.css file in the root of our project. I usually create a structure like <code class="inline">css/sass/</code> then place all of my <code class="inline">.scss</code> files in the sass folder. Let's go ahead and create our <code class="inline">style.scss</code> file in there.</p><p>Since we are making a theme, we need a few comments at the top, then we can import in the <code class="inline">bootstrap.scss</code> file that we pulled down with Bower. You will need to figure out the path to it, then use an <code class="inline">@import</code> to bring it in like so:</p><pre class="brush: css">/*!

// Import Bootstrap styles
@import '../../bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap';</pre><p>I'm using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass">grunt-contrib-sass</a>&nbsp;in my example project, now when we run our Sass compiler, it will compile the <code class="inline">bootstrap.scss</code> into our <code class="inline">style.css</code> file. Now we have all of the Bootstrap styles added to our project.</p><h2><b>Customizing Components</b></h2><p>There are two ways that you can customize these components: I'm going to focus on the styling. One way is to override the styles with another stylesheet or lower in the order of things being compiled in your <code class="inline">.scss</code> files. Another way, the one I recommend, is to override the existing <code class="inline">.scss</code> files that you are pulling in with Bower.</p><p>Let's look at the <code class="inline">bootstrap.scss</code> file that I referenced in the previous section. It is essentially importing to the other <code class="inline">.scss</code> files it needs to compile. If you look at the files and the order in which things are being imported, you should see the <code class="inline">variables.scss</code> file at the top. As a project,&nbsp;Bootstrap has done a great job of extracting out commonly overriden or reused styles like colors and font sizes into here.</p><p>What we can do is copy the <code class="inline">bootstrap.scss</code> file and add it as one of our theme's <code class="inline">.scss</code> files in the <code class="inline">css/sass</code> folder. Once we do that we will want to change the path of all of the files it imports to point to our <code class="inline">bower_components</code> directory.</p><p>We can also add our own <code class="inline">.scss</code> files inside this file to override things, like the sass variables in <code class="inline">variables.scss</code>. Let's say you wanted to update the background color. There's a variable inside of Bootstrap's <code class="inline">variables.scs</code> file called <code class="inline">$body-bg</code>, and we can simply override that in our theme's <code class="inline">variables.scss</code> file.</p><p>Both examples above would be changing from this:</p><pre class="brush: css">// Core variables and mixins
@import "bootstrap/variables";
@import "bootstrap/mixins";</pre><p>to this:</p><pre class="brush: css">// Core variables and mixins
@import "../../bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/variables";
// Overriding default Bootstrap variables
@import "variables";
@import "../../bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/mixins";</pre><p>This is one thing that is a little bit harder to explain without a concrete demo, so I put together an <a href="https://github.com/jbrad/tuts-bower">example on GitHub</a> so you can take a look.</p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p>This concludes our series on Bower. We talked about what Bower is, how it can help your WordPress development and now talked about how to set it up.&nbsp;</p><p>Bower has really become the defacto frontend dependency manager, so I hope this helps you know the concept and understand how to&nbsp;utilize&nbsp;it in your own projects.</p><h2><b>Resources</b></h2><ul>

You learn from other people's code and learn to write better code yourself.&nbsp;Seeing an open source project you've worked on with other developers come together is one of the most rewarding feelings I've experienced as a developer.</p><p>Let's start by taking a look at some popular examples of open source software. You may be surprised by the sheer volume of open source projects and also by some of the companies behind these projects, like <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_self">Google</a> and <a href="http://automattic.com" target="_self">Automattic</a>.</p></div><h2><span class="sectionnum">2.</span>&nbsp;Popular Examples</h2><div><p>There are millions of open source projects available. Below is a list of some very popular and notable examples.</p><ul><li><a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_self">WordPress</a>, one of the most popular content management system on the web, is&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wordpress.com/stats/" target="_self">used by millions of people</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_self">PHP</a>&nbsp;is the most popular web programming language on the web, powering Facebook and more than 80% of the web.</li><li><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_self">Audacity</a>&nbsp;is a free, easy to use, multi-track audio editor and recorder.</li><li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_self">OpenOffice</a>&nbsp;is a free alternative to Microsoft Office.</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href="http://source.android.com/" target="_self">Android Open Source Project</a>&nbsp;is the official mobile operating system as an open source project.</li><li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/" target="_self">Firefox OS</a>&nbsp;is the mobile operating system developed and maintained by <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_self">Mozilla</a>.</li></ul></div><h2><span class="sectionnum">3.</span> How It Works</h2><div><p>An open source project typically involves three stages. Let's take a quick look at each stage.</p><h3>Stage 1: Contributing</h3><p>If you're wanting to get involved with an open source project, you could begin by contacting the organization behind the software itself and asking what opportunities they have going.&nbsp;This method will work well for smaller-scale projects, or startups, however, you should be aware that the majority of open source projects will not pay for your work and that it's done on a voluntary basis.</p><p>In the past, when I've worked on open source projects, I've had to wait weeks (and in one case, two months) before I received a response, but you should sit in there and wait for that all important confirmation email, and then you're good to go.</p><p>Alternatively, for larger-scale projects, you can simply start coding and forking your own version of the software. You should be wary though that if lots of people are working on the same project as you, that your hard work may not be included in the final release of the product, so brace yourself for rejection.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration on a project to start working on, there's always lots of interesting projects to work on, especially if you look on sites like GitHub, SourceForge, and Google Code.</p><p>Before you begin actually working on the project, you should familiarize yourself with how the project is being run and and how its management is structured so you know who to go to if you require assistance with something. Also, it's a good idea to check you know exactly what you're doing before you begin, as you either don't want to mess things up, or waste your time working on a feature that someone else is already working on, for example.<br></p><h3>Stage 2: Committing</h3><p>When you've made the changes you want or implemented the feature you had in mind, you commit your changes to the main project and send them to the maintainers of the project for review.</p><p>This may be done using GitHub or on a platform like SourceForge. Your changes will usually receive a <i>yes</i> or a <i>no</i> from the organization or the team in charge of the project, indicating whether or not your changes are going to be included in the project. If they are, then it's time for the distribution stage. If not, then it's back to the contribution stage.</p><h3>Stage 3: Distributing</h3></div><p>Possibly the most complex stage of all is the distribution of an open source project. Here, the final version is committed to the repository where the project has been hosted and live versions for non-developers are updated. At this point, the organization and developers say good bye to their hard work and hand it over to the public for general use, and of course, critique.</p><h2>In Summary</h2><div><p>I hope you now feel more confident about open source development and how you can get involved with a project yourself. Open source can be really interesting, but also very frustrating at times. The key thing to keep in mind, though, is to keep going and to not give up when you hit an obstacle.</p><p>In the next part of this series, we'll take a look at licensing for open source projects and what some of the available options are for developers&nbsp;If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them for you in the comments below.</p></div><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21278/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21278/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21278/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21278/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T14:25:04.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T14:25:04.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

Testing simultaneously on other devices and systems you might have is difficult.</p><p>In this quick article, I'm going to explain how to use&nbsp;<a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_self">Codekit 2.0</a>&nbsp;and speed up your local development&nbsp;workflow with style injection, browser refreshing, and device testing without touching a line of code to setup!<br></p>

<h2>Local&nbsp;WordPress Development</h2>

<p>In order to get started, you'll need to setup WordPress locally. We have a couple of articles on Tuts+ to help you get started using <b>MAMP</b> (a local server environment comprising&nbsp;<b>M</b>ac,<b>&nbsp;</b><b>A</b>pache, <b>M</b>ySQL and&nbsp;<b>P</b>HP, <b>P</b>erl or <b>P</b>ython):</p><ul><li><a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-killer-wordpress-testing-environment-locally--net-5065" rel="external" target="_blank">How to Set Up a Killer WordPress Testing Environment Locally</a></li><li><a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/skeleton-to-wordpress-getting-up-and-running--webdesign-7943" rel="external" target="_blank">Skeleton to WordPress: Getting up and Running</a><br></li></ul><p>After MAMP is installed, make sure it is running.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/30/posts/19402/image/mamp.png"></figure><p>You will also need to know the local URL (often&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a>&nbsp;by default,&nbsp;but you can define this Apache port&nbsp;in MAMP preferences). Make sure you have the local site working properly before you continue.</p>

<h2>Codekit Configuration</h2>

<p><a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/" rel="external" target="_blank">Codekit</a> recently made a major upgrade to 2.0, offering simultaneous browser refreshing across multiple devices, plus style injection. In just a couple of steps, you can setup Codekit to work with your local&nbsp;WordPress setup.</p>

<p>After your local WordPress installation is ready to go and you have MAMP running, add your theme as a project to Codekit. You can do this by dragging the theme's folder into Codekit.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/51/posts/19402/image/codekit-project.gif"></figure>

<h3>External Server Settings<br></h3><p>Next we need to tell Codekit where our local MAMP server is running, so&nbsp;let's update the "External Server" settings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the gear beneath the project's name in Codekit.</li>
<li>Click the second option labeled <b>Browser Refreshing</b> in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <b>External Server </b>settings and turn <b>External Server Required</b> ON.</li>
<li>Update the <b>External Server Address</b> with the local MAMP&nbsp;URL of the WordPress site (for example <a href="http://localhost:8888/your-local-site">http://localhost:8888/your-local-site</a>, or as in this example <a href="http://wptest.dev">http://wptest.dev</a>). Make sure you visit this URL to guarantee it is the correct and functioning properly.</li></ol><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/51/posts/19402/image/codekit-server.jpg"></figure>

<p>To start using the server, click the preview button at the top right of Codekit. It will open your browser with a unique url (<a href="http://your-computer-name">http://your-computer-name.local:5757</a>). You can now&nbsp;manually visit that url&nbsp;on any other devices connected to your wi-fi network to connect to Codekit's browser refreshing and style injections.</p><p>When you save a file in your code editor, the browser will refresh, or if you're updating the stylesheet, Codekit will inject the new style changes.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/51/posts/19402/image/codekit-styleinject.gif"></figure>

<p>Codekit also offers Sass compiling (with Libass), style injection, browser refreshing, syntax checking, minification, hooks and more with just one program!&nbsp;If you're already using MAMP, give Codekit a go and watch it speed up your workflow.</p>

It has simplified website development and management for even the most amateur users.</p><p>However, there are still times when you see a certain website design, which immediately catches your eye, and you want to modify your own website to appear the same.&nbsp;Unfortunately, if you're a complete amateur, you won't be able to do much even with WordPress, since theme modifications require a certain degree of expertise in HTML, CSS, PHP and several other skills depending upon the nature of your theme. But even if you're an expert coder, it might still take you a few hours to make the desired modifications.</p><p>Fortunately, the WordPress <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/visual-composer-page-builder-for-wordpress/242431" target="_self">Visual Composer plugin</a> has simplified this problem. With this awesome page building plugin, even the most basic WordPress users can modify theme designs and create a completely unique look for their website. For WordPress experts, itâs a major time saver and can help them modify pages in just a few minutes. Overall, the plugin has been such a big success that itâs already included in many of the latest WordPress themes.</p><p>So with this background, let me walk you through some of the main features of the Visual Composer, and how it can be set up for your WordPress website.</p><h2>Main Features</h2><p>Visual Composer is designed by the guys at <a href="http://codecanyon.net/user/wpbakery" target="_self">WP Bakery</a>. Itâs a paid plugin that is not openly available on the WordPress plugin directory. You can only download it from <a href="http://codecanyon.net/" target="_self">CodeCanyon</a>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image1.jpg"></figure><p>It has been downloaded by more than 70,000 users and it only seems headed towards more success! Visual Composer has several highly useful features that can make page building an extremely enjoyable experience in WordPress. Here's a quick look at some of them.</p><h3>Frontend and Backend Page Building</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image2.jpg"></figure><p>The most powerful feature of the Visual Composer is that it gives you an easy drag and drop page builder that can be used from the standard WordPress page/post edit area or directly from the frontend.</p><h3>Universal Theme Compatibility</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image3.jpg"></figure><p>Visual Composer is not theme specific. This means you can use it with any WordPress theme without needing to make any adjustments to the existing code.</p><h3>Highly Customisable Layout</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image4.jpg"></figure><p>The drag and drop elements of the Visual Composer have a default layout and theme. However, you can modify this according to the color scheme and looks of your website.</p><h3>More Than 40 Ready to Use Design Elements</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image5.jpg"></figure><p>The drag and drop interface of the Visual Composer has more than 40 ready to use drag and drop elements which can be used to create unique layouts for your website within minutes.</p><h3>Completely Responsive Elements</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image6.jpg"></figure><p>The design and page elements created with the Visual Composer are completely responsive and mobile ready.</p><h3>Developer Friendly</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image7.jpg"></figure><p>The Visual Composer is full of versatile drag &amp; drop elements. If you want to add more, you can easily do it thanks to its developer friendly nature.</p><h2>Plugin Installation and Configuration</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, Visual Composer is a paid plugin. So, you'll need to buy it first and then upload it to your WordPress site.</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p>The installation process is the same as any other WordPress plugin. Once activated, the plugin will appear in the Settings option on the left menu in the main WordPress dashboard.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image8.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Here, you can adjust some of the basic plugin settings.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image9.jpg"><br></p><h3>Step 3</h3><p>You can enable the Visual Composer for both Pages and Posts, or any one of them. You can also set specific access rights for individual user types.&nbsp;For each user type, you can choose to display both the Visual Composer in the post edit area and the standard WordPress editor, or you can display only the Visual Composer. You can also enable or disable individual Visual Composer elements for different users.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image10.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>In the <b>Design Options</b> tab, you can modify the look and feel of the Visual Composer elements according to the theme of your website.&nbsp;The <b>Custom CSS</b> tab allows you to modify the CSS without changing any other file, while the Product License tab allows you to integrate your Envato account to enable support and automatic updates. In the <b>My Shortcodes</b> tab, you can add any additional manually developed shortcodes to the existing list of shortcodes in the Visual Composer.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image11.jpg"></figure><p>Now let's move on to the actual usage of the plugin!<br></p><h2>Using VC on Pages and Posts</h2><p>As I mentioned above, you can enable the Visual Composer for Posts, Pages or any one of them. After activating the plugin, youâll see the Visual Editor tabs on top of your standard WordPress text editor.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image12.jpg"></figure><p>The two tabs that appear on top of the text editor are <b>Backend Editor</b> and <b>Frontend Editor</b>. These are the options that make this plugin such a joy to use. From here, you can create any page structure you want.&nbsp;Let's start with the backend editor.</p><h3>Backend Editor</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image13.jpg"></figure><h4>Step 1</h4><p>When you click on the <b>Backend editor</b> tab, your text editor area will change into a drag and drop box where you can add elements by simply selecting them from the list.&nbsp;But first, you need to add a row. From here, the only thing limiting your design will be your imagination.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image14.jpg"></figure><h4>Step 2</h4><p>You can add different elements in the row and also choose different column layouts for each row by hovering your mouse pointer on the button above the content editor. You can add different elements to design your page from the <b>Add element</b> tab.&nbsp;The <b>Add elements</b>&nbsp;box contains everything you need to design a website.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image15.jpg"></figure><p>The elements are divided into categories of&nbsp;Content, Social, Site Structure, New Elements and WordPress Widgets, but you can view all of them together as well. Whichever option you need, just click on it and drag it in your content box. Your page is basically divided into different rows. You can keep adding new rows and new elements within those rows.</p><h4>Step 3</h4><p>To edit, delete or duplicate any particular row, just use the icons on top of each row box.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image16.jpg"></figure><h4>Step 4</h4><p>You can save a particular content arrangement as a ready to use template that can be loaded from the list anytime you need it.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image17.jpg"></figure><h4>Step 5</h4><p>The Visual Composer also allows you to add custom CSS for individual pages and posts. The effects of this custom CSS will be limited to that particular page or post only.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image18.jpg"></figure><p>Visual Composer also supports several famous WordPress plugins like <i>Contact Form 7</i>, <i>Layer Slider</i>, <i>Revolution Slider</i> and <i>Gravity Forms</i>. If you have any of these plugins installed, they will be added automatically to the <b>Add element</b>&nbsp;box. When you select any of them from the list of elements, it will be directly inserted in your page without the need for adding any shortcodes. The backend editor gives you so much flexibility and options that you can create any kind of design even if youâre an amateur user.</p><h3>Frontend Editor</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image19.jpg"></figure><p>The frontend editor lets you drag &amp; drop page elements in live page view. It makes it easier to see the impact of your changes straight away while having all the options of the backend editor as well.&nbsp;<br></p><h4>Step 1</h4><p>Starting from the left, you can add new elements by clicking on the <b>+</b> sign and edit the column's layout with the column button next to it.</p><h4>Step 2</h4><p>You can also add new rows or columns from the <b>+</b> sign within the page content.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image20.jpg"></figure><h4>Step 3</h4><p>All the elements of the Visual Composer are completely responsive and mobile ready. You can get the live preview for different devices in the frontend editor from the icons below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image21.jpg"></figure><h4>Step 4</h4><p>Despite all these features and the wide range of elements, Visual Composer allows you to add your own shortcodes and design elements as well. You can create the elements yourself or import them from any third party service.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/130/posts/21410/image/image22.png"></figure><h2>In Summary</h2><p>WordPress has always been a flexible platform in terms of the different functions it can support through its plugins. But with the Visual Composer page builder plugin, even the design aspect of WordPress, which was once limited to the advanced users only, can now be edited in very quick time.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, personally, the Visual Composer has significantly reduced the time, I used to spend on client website design and editing tasks, from several hours to a few minutes. And with the rising popularity of this plugin, I can only see more and more WordPress users rely on it in the coming days.</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21410/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21410/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21410/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21410/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T13:00:16.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T13:00:16.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

environmentalism, saving energy is a smart business strategy.<br></p><p>Consider the fact that small businesses in
the US spend <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/ia/business/challenge/learn_more/SmallBusiness.pdf">more
than $60 billion</a> on energy. One <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherclancy/2014/03/25/sharper-focus-for-energy-management-small-businesses/">survey</a>
found that the majority of small and medium-sized firms spend more than 10% of their
annual revenue on electricity. </p><p>Thatâs a big slice of your business that
youâre paying out just to keep the lights on. So if you can cut those costs by
being more energy-efficient, youâll see the benefit immediately on your bottom
line.</p><p>In this tutorial, weâre going to look at
the benefits of saving energy, and some simple strategies you can use to begin
saving today. Weâll also cover how you can decide whether itâs worth making
bigger investments like installing solar panels, and show you how to access
government grants and tax credits for green businesses. And weâll talk about
how you can use your eco-friendly credentials to win new customers.</p><h2>Step 1: Why Save Energy?</h2><p>If you still need some convincing, hereâs a
quick rundown of the benefits you can enjoy from becoming more energy efficient:</p><h3>Cut Costs</h3><p>According to the US governmentâs <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/ia/business/challenge/learn_more/SmallBusiness.pdf">Energy
Star</a> program, small businesses can cut their utility costs by 10-30% âwithout
sacrificing service, quality, style, or comfort.â A few concrete examples:</p><ul><li>Vic's IGA Market in Sacramento,
CA, <i>saved more than $48,000 a year</i> by installing brighter, efficient T-8
lamps/electronic ballasts, a new chiller compressor, and new, enclosed freezers
to replace old, open multi-deck freezers.</li><li>River Run Bed &amp; Breakfast
in Kerrville, TX, <i>saved $2,400 a year</i>
by installing efficient lighting, insulation, high-efficiency heat pump units,
programmable thermostats, and variable speed drives on air circulating fans.</li><li>Music Mart, Inc. in State
College, PA, <i>saved $1,840 a year</i> by
upgrading its lighting and replacing two old air conditioners with newer, more
efficient models with timers.</li></ul><h3>Happy Customers</h3><p>Weâll cover the customer benefits in more
detail in step 5, but for now weâll just say that surveys show environmental
considerations becoming more and more important in consumersâ spending
decisions, particularly among the younger generation. If you can genuinely
claim to be a âgreenâ business, youâll not only see cost savings, but also
generate more revenue from environmentally-conscious customers.</p><h3>Happy Employees</h3><p>âThe environmentâ doesnât just mean the
global environmentâitâs also the workplace. When you replace old, clunky air
conditioners with newer, more efficient models, or upgrade the lighting, or add
insulation, the result is often a much more comfortable working environment for
your staff. The new lighting at Music Mart, for example, generated the same
amount of light, but much less heat, a big benefit for people working there all
day.</p><h3>A Cleaner Environment<br></h3><p>If you use less energy, that means a bit
less mining, drilling and transportation of coal, oil and gas, a bit less air
pollution from burning these fuels, and a few more resources left for the next
generation to play with. Weâre focusing more on the direct economic benefits to
your business in this tutorial, but the wider benefits are also very real.</p><h2>Step 2: Simple Savings</h2><p>So how do you go about saving energy? There
are essentially two approaches: you can take a lot of small, low-cost actions,
hoping that the small efficiency gain from each one adds up to major savings,
or you can go for a more expensive project with higher impact, like overhauling
your buildingâs heating system or installing renewable energy generators.</p><p>Weâre going to look at the small, low-cost
actions first, and then in step 3 weâll move on to the bigger projects.</p><h3>Knowledge is Power</h3><p>Before you dive into making changes to your
business, you need to assess your current energy usage. Tools like Energy
Starâs free <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager">Portfolio
Manager</a> enable you to input details about your companyâs building or
buildings, and see how efficiently youâre using energy. The system will give
you a score of between 1 and 100, with a higher score indicating more
efficiency. </p><p>You might find that your head office scores
75, for example, but your warehouse scores 30, and so youâd focus your efforts
on the warehouse first. You can then track the impact of your energy efficiency
measures over time.</p><p>Also check what your utility company can do
for you. Many now offer access to software that shows how youâre using energy,
or will provide free or low-cost energy audits to help you identify areas for
improvement.</p><h3>Lighting</h3><p>Nearly <a href="http://www.asbdc-us.org/Resources/Energy_Efficiency_Pays.pdf">75%</a> of
all energy upgrades by small businesses are related to lighting. Thatâs because
there are lots of low-cost things you can do to make immediate savings.</p><p>If youâre still using traditional
âincandescentâ light bulbs, for example, you should know that only 5% of the
electricity they consume is converted to useful light. Energy-efficient light
bulbs cost more up front, but last 10 times as long and are 4 times as
efficient. Itâs a simple improvement to make.</p><p>Occupancy sensors are also relatively
cheap, available for between $25 and $80, and are a great option for areas that
arenât used much. In restrooms, for example, they can save up to 75% of energy
costs, and in meeting rooms up to 65%.</p><p>And think about whether you can reduce the
amount of lighting, or make better use of natural light. Hallways and corridors
donât always need bright lighting, and sometimes people working at computers
prefer slightly dimmer light to give greater screen contrast.</p><h3>Office Equipment</h3><p>It sounds simple, but it makes a big
difference. Just switching off your computers and photocopiers when theyâre not
in use can make big savings. Powering a large photocopier down at night can <a href="http://www.asbdc-us.org/Resources/Energy_Efficiency_Pays.pdf" target="_self">save $660 a year</a>, and doing the same with computers can save $68 a year. Not huge
savings, but theyâre easy actions to take, and if youâre using a lot of
equipment it really adds up. Make sure computers are set to power down
automatically when not in use.</p><h3>Heating and Cooling</h3><p>This is the biggest energy user,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asbdc-us.org/Resources/Energy_Efficiency_Pays.pdf">39%</a> of
energy used in US commercial buildings goes on heating, ventilation and air
conditioning.</p><p>Simply cleaning or replacing air filters
regularly (at least quarterly) gives you better energy efficiency, and using a
programmable thermostat keeps costs down. Using ceiling fans to help air
circulating will reduce your energy usage, and not only in summerâtheyâre also
good in winter, because they push warm air down from the ceiling.</p>







<p>Think about sunlight, too. Blocking direct
sunlight from the windows in summer keeps down air conditioning costs, while
letting it in during winter gives you some free heating. The impact of each
of these small actions may be minor, but together they can add up to
significant cost savings.</p><h2>Step 3: Major Investments</h2><p>So what if youâve already picked all the
low-hanging fruit? Youâre monitoring your energy usage, and youâre being as
efficient as possible in major areas like heating and cooling, lighting and
office equipment.</p><p>The next step is to look at major projects
to upgrade your facilities. Examples would be putting solar panels on the roof,
overhauling the heating system, re-insulating all your buildings, or investing
in brand new, energy-efficient equipment.</p><p>This type of project often requires major
upfront investment, however, and you want to make sure you get a reasonable
payoff. So how do you calculate the expected savings, and decide which project
is worth implementing?</p><p>Letâs say that you plan to buy a new
air-conditioning system for your office building. The new system costs $600,
but youâre currently spending $800 a year on air conditioning, and the new
system is 25% more efficient, meaning that youâll save $200 a year. Is it worth
it?</p><p>To calculate how long it will take for the
new system to pay for itself, simply&nbsp;
divide the cost of the improvement by the annual energy savings. In this
case:</p><p><i>Payback period = 600 / 200 = 3 years</i></p><p>This looks like a good investment. The new
equipment will pay for itself in 3 years, and after that youâre in the money
for as long as the equipment lasts.</p><p>This is a simple example, but youâd use the
same method for more complex installations like solar panels. Estimate the
energy savings you can expect, and then divide the initial cost by the annual
energy savings. Generally a payback in 3 or 4 years is worthwhile; longer than
that, and youâll be waiting a long time before you start to see the benefits.</p><h2>Step 4: Get Government Assistance</h2><p>There are many government programs to
encourage businesses to embrace energy efficiency. So as well as the cost
savings from the improvements you make, you can access tax credits, grants,
loan programs and other government assistance. Weâre focusing on US programs
here, but similar programs exist in many other countries.</p><p>You can get a federal <a href="http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=US02F">tax
credit</a> for 30% of the cost of installing solar energy systems or other
renewable energy measures, for example. State and local governments also have a
huge number of programs. You can search for them by using <a href="http://energy.gov/savings/energy-efficiency-grants">this Department of
Energy online search tool</a>. Simply put in your state, and it will give you
all the energy-efficiency tax credits and deductions available to you. In New
York, for example, there are 132 different programs aimed at particular areas,
towns or business types.</p><p>Also search <a href="http://www.grants.gov/web/grants">Grants.gov</a> for special energy
efficiency grants you could access. Right now, for example, the <a href="http://www.grants.gov/search-grants.html?fundingCategories%3DEN%7CEnergy">Renewable
Energy for America Program</a> is offering anywhere from $5,000 to $500,000 to
rural small businesses and farms that are making energy efficiency
improvements. The closing date for applications is July 7, 2014. The
opportunities change all the time, so keep going back to see if thereâs
something that applies to your business.</p><p>There are also special Department of Energy
loan programs, EPA grants, Small Business Innovation Grants and more. You can
get more details at the <a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/environmental-grants-loans">Small Business
Administration</a> website. </p><h2>Step 5: The Power of Green Marketing</h2><p>A recent <a href="http://www.prweek.com/article/consumers-getting-environmentally-conscious/1276219">survey</a>
found that 71% of US consumers consider the environment when theyâre making
purchases. Separate <a href="https://www.fmi.org/docs/sustainability/BBMG_Conscious_Consumer_White_Paper.pdf">research</a>
found that 88% of American self-identify as âconscious consumersâ and 86% as
âenvironmentally-friendly.â</p><p>That means that a high proportion of your
customers are likely concerned about the environment to some degree, and will
think more highly of your business if you make them aware of the energy-saving
measures youâve taken.</p><p>If youâve made big improvements, it could
be a newsworthy story that local media outlets would pick up, giving your
company free publicity and spreading the image of your company as
environmentally conscious.</p><p>You can also highlight your firmâs green
credentials in your marketing. Be careful, though, because consumers have
become wary of âgreenwashing,â or companies making unsubstantiated environmental
claims. If youâve saved energy in your buildings, but are still running a fleet
of gas-guzzling delivery trucks or manufacturing non-recyclable products,
attempts to present yourself as a green firm could backfire.</p><p>So itâs best to avoid making sweeping
claims, unless environmental sustainability truly is at the heart of your whole
business. Stick to specific facts that you can back up, for example mentioning
in your marketing brochure that you cut energy usage by 30% and are committed
to making further improvements.</p><p>Also think beyond individual consumers.
Green credentials can give you an advantage in the B2B (âbusiness to businessâ)
space too. Many large companies, organizations and government departments have
their own environmental objectives. If they can do business with an
eco-friendly supplier (i.e. you), then that helps them meet their goals too.</p><h2>A Smart Business Decision</h2><p>In this tutorial, youâve seen how your
business could cut costs by taking steps to save energy. Youâve learned the
benefits of saving energy, how to put it into practice both through small steps
and major projects, how to access government grants, tax credits and other
assistance, and how to get extra benefits by communicating the changes to your
customers.</p><p>As you can see, âgoing greenâ isnât about
making sacrifices or spending more money. Itâs actually a smart business
decision that can cut your costs, make you eligible for government perks, and
boost your popularity with employees and customers. You need to evaluate each
investment, of course, to make sure it pays off, but if you invest wisely, you
could see a significant impact not just on the environment, but also on your
companyâs bottom line.<br></p><h2>Resources</h2><p>Graphic Credit: <a href="http://thenounproject.com/term/solar-panel/1131/" target="_self">Solar-Panel</a>&nbsp;designed by&nbsp;<a href="http://thenounproject.com/modik">Modik</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a>.</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21378/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21378/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21378/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21378/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T12:55:42.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T12:55:42.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<h2>How the Firmware Password Works</h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21409/image/Firmware password.jpg"><figcaption>Apple's quick explanation of Mac's onboard firmware password ability.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Apple began implementing <i>Open Firmware Password Protection</i> in OS X 10.1 with the Open Firmware 4.1.7 update. It was available on select models in early development, but eventually made its way to all Macs.&nbsp;</p><p>The current lineup features full support for the configuration of a firmware password, but is known as an EFI (<i>Extensible Firmware Interface</i>) password due to Macs now being Intel-based.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21409/image/Firmware utility.jpg"><figcaption>OS X's Recovery Mode <b>Utilities</b> menu.</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can think of a firmware password as one more layer between you and a local (able to access the machine with his hands rather than remotely) hacker.&nbsp;</p><p>If you read my tutorial on <a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-reset-os-x-user-account-passwords--mac-48660">resetting OS X user passwords</a>, youâll know that if <b>FileVault 2</b> is enabled, your password can be reset in a matter of minutes and an intruder will gain access to all the information on your computer if heâs using an administrator account. If this individual has a lot of time with the machine, he may even be able to break through FileVault.&nbsp;</p><p>A firmware password prevents any of this by adding a hardware-level layer of security and restricting access to different boot options, whether it be single-user, off an external or optical disk, or <b>Recovery Mode</b>.</p>

<p>When combined with <b>FileVault 2</b>, the firmware password makes the Mac monumentally secure. For someone to steal your information, theyâd have to remove the hard drive and decrypt it. This also means that losing this password can be disastrous.&nbsp;</p><p>Only Apple can reset firmware passwords on newer Macs thanks to the number of logic board integration components, like RAM and batteries. So, before you proceed, make sure you write the password down on a physical notepad just in case.</p>

<h2>Enabling the Firmware Password</h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21409/image/Set firmware password.jpg"><figcaption>Setting the firmware password.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Before you begin, remember that if your computer doesnât have removable RAM, <strong>only Apple will be able to reset this password if you lose it</strong>. With this in mind, hereâs how to get started.</p>

<ol>
<li>Boot into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> by restarting the Mac and holding <strong>Command-R</strong> for about five seconds before it turns back on.</li>
<li>When prompted, select the <b>language</b> and click the <b>right arrow</b>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Utilities</strong> menu at the top of the screen and select <strong>Firmware Password Utility</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Turn On Firmware Password</strong> to set up a firmware-level password on your computer.</li>
<li>Enter the password you wish to use in the <strong>New Password</strong> field and confirm it in the <strong>Verify</strong> field, then click <strong>Set Password</strong> to apply it to the firmware. Remember to use something different than any of your user passwords. I recommend <a href="https://strongpasswordgenerator.com/">generating a password</a>&nbsp;of at least ten characters for better security.</li>
<li>The <strong>Firmware Password Utility</strong> will inform you that the password will be applied upon a restart. Click <strong>Quit Firmware Password Utility</strong>, select the Apple menu in the top left of the screen, and click <strong>Restart</strong> to finish the process.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the Firmware Password</h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21409/image/Firmware password entry.jpg"><figcaption>Entering the firmware password for alternative boot methods.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Upon exiting <b>Recovery Mode</b> via a system restart, you wonât notice anything different. The Mac will boot up normally, unless you decided to hold a modifier key and boot using an alternate method.&nbsp;</p><p>Should you decide to boot back into Recovery or single-user mode, you will be shown a simple lock icon and asked for the machineâs firmware password, as shown in the screenshot above.</p>

<p>Enter the firmware password into the field, followed by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> or clicking the <b>arrow icon</b> to the right. The screen might appear to be frozen for a moment, but the computer will eventually make its way to the alternate boot mode provided you entered the correct password.&nbsp;</p><p>If you didnât, the password field will become blank once again. You can enter the password as many times as youâd like, but there is no hint or way to reset it on this screen.</p>

<h2>Changing or Disabling the Firmware Password</h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21409/image/Firmware password change.jpg"><figcaption>Back in the Firmware Password Utility to change or disable the password.</figcaption></figure>

<p>If youâre selling the Mac or giving it to a friend, you may need to change or disable your firmware password. The process is nearly the same as setting it up.</p>

<ol>
<li>Once again, boot into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> by restarting the computer and holding <strong>Command-R</strong> for about five seconds before it turns back on. Youâll be asked to enter the firmware password. Do so and press <strong>enter</strong> or click the arrow to the right of the password field.</li>
<li>When prompted, select the <b>language</b> and click the <b>right arrow</b>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Utilities</strong> menu at the top of the screen and select <strong>Firmware Password Utility</strong>.</li>
<li>To change the firmware password, click the <strong>Change Password</strong> button, enter the current password in the <strong>Old Password</strong> field, and the desired one in the <strong>New Password</strong> and <strong>Verify</strong> fields. Click <strong>Change Password</strong> when finished.</li>
<li>To disable the firmware password, click the <strong>Turn Off Firmware Password</strong> button. Enter the current firmware password and confirm that you would like to disable firmware-level security by clicking the <strong>Turn Off Password</strong> button.</li>
<li>Finally, select the <b>Apple menu</b> in the top left of the screen and click <strong>Restart</strong>. Both changes will be applied once the Mac has been restarted.</li>
</ol>

<figure><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UCdQC_VGgSw?list=PLgGbWId6zgaXLkSpgTq_lm9PLN2471ac6" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure>
<p>In
this article, you'll discover the standard components of
invitations and tips for selecting details such as color, sizes and
paper that will get you started designing your own invitations in no
time.<br></p><h2><span class="sectionnum">1.</span>&nbsp;<b>The Invitation Card</b></h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/264/posts/20896/image/invitations-01.jpg"></figure><p>The invitation card
is the most important element of your invitation. It's the item that
features all the event information and special details such as
colors, graphics and images that match the event. Cards come in all
shapes and sizes but classic invites come in either a portrait or
landscape format and are usually folded in half at an A7 size
(5âx7â). You can easily go larger or smaller, but if you are just
starting out designing invites, this is the size to work with first.
You can also change things up by going with flat invitations that are
printed on both sides without a fold, similar to a postcard.<br></p><h3><b>Paper Options</b></h3><p>
Just like size, paper options are vast for invitations. From textured
paper stock to glossy cover stock, how do you choose the paper that's
right for your event? Remember that paper choice will determine cost,
so many people choose a paper that both fits their budget and also
maximizes the impact of their invitation. A standard approach to
paper is looking at gloss versus matte and cover versus text stock.
Choosing a glossy cover stock offers a heavier and sturdy option over
a text stock and also makes lots of graphics and colors more vibrant.
A linen stock is a nice alternative to the standard gloss cover stock
with a focus on matte printing for colors with added texture to the
paper. How do you decide which option is best? If your invite
features a lot of color and imagery, go with a gloss stock. If your
focus is simpler with emphasis on text and subtle illustrations, a
matte paper stock with texture will make those elements pop while the
texture will give additional visual and tactile elements to your
invite.</p><h2><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><b>2.&nbsp;</b></span><b>The Invitation Envelope</b></h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/264/posts/20896/image/invitations-04.jpg"></figure><p>Next up, the
envelope. Envelopes, like invites, come in all colors and sizes. You
have the option to go with a solid color envelope that matches your
invitation color scheme or choose a white envelope and print a
matching design onto it. Your invitation size will determine the size
of your envelope. For example, an A7 invite (5âx7â) means you'll
need an A7 (5.25âx7.25â) envelope to fit your invite.</p><h3><b>Types of
Invitation Envelopes</b></h3><p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/264/posts/20896/image/invitations-02.jpg"><br>
</p><p>
Two classic invitations types are baronial and announcement. The main
difference of these two types comes down to their flap shapes.
Baronial invites feature a pointy flap while an announcement envelope
has a square flap.</p><h3><b>Choosing Colors</b></h3><p>
Envelopes come in a variety of colors including bright florescent,
metallic, translucent vellum, patterned, and neutral colors such as
white, black and ivory. Envelopes can also have foiled interiors for
a special pop of color. How do you choose the right envelope for your
event? Start by considering how you intend to mail your invite. If
you need to print addresses, a dark color won't work and you'll have
to use a white label. Not as elegant. Instead, you can choose a
lighter color or white and print design elements onto the envelope
leaving room for your address and postage on the right. The envelope
is the perfect opportunity to bring in colors from your design either
through the envelope color itself, or a printed design.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">3.</span>&nbsp;<b>The Reply Card</b></h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/264/posts/20896/image/invitations-03.jpg"></figure><p>Reply cards are the guests' way
to send back their RSVP to your event. Reply cards can be
double-sided or not. They also typically feature a place for guests
to leave their name and contact information that help event planners
obtain an estimated attendance count. Reply cards are smaller than
the invite because they fit inside it. For example, if your invite is
an A7, you'll want to use an A2 (5.5âx4.125â) reply card.<br></p><h3><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small"><b>Colors
and Paper Stock</b></span></h3><p>
<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">Most of the attention goes to
the invite, so reply cards can be as simple as a black and white
design on a white card stock. Other options might be using a solid
text color that matches your design instead of black text. Either
way, guests are going to write on this card, so dark text stock is
out.</span></p><h2><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">4.&nbsp;</span>The Reply Envelope</h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/264/posts/20896/image/invitations-05.jpg"></figure><p>If you are supplying a reply
card, you'll want to make it easy for your guests to send it back
with a reply envelope. Reply envelopes  are simple with a return
address right in the middle. Want to increase the chance your guests
will use it? Add the bonus of a prepaid stamp. You don't have to do
this for every event, but specialty events like galas and fundraisers
commonly do this to increase the chance they'll get their reply cards
back. Remember the size you choose for your reply card means the
envelope size will directly correlate with this choice. For example,
an A2 card means an A2 envelope (5.75âx4.375â). It's slightly
larger to accommodate the insert.<br></p><h3><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small"><b>Colors</b></span></h3><p>
<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">Just like invitation envelopes,
reply envelopes can be baronial or announcement. They are essentially
the same thing, just a different size. This means you have the same
options with colors and can have some fun with this simple invite
component. Dress up the inside of your invite with a pop of color
from your reply envelope. Is red a color of choice in your design?
Choose a solid red reply envelope with black return address type.
This provides an instant pop of color when someone opens your invite.
You can also dress up a classic black and white invite with a bright
color. The opportunities here are endless.</span></p><h2><span class="sectionnum">5.</span>&nbsp;The Special Insert</h2><p>
<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">Special inserts offer the
opportunity to add extra information to your invite without fitting
it all on the invitation card. Examples of this would be a listing of
additional events tied to the main event such as a list of exhibits
at an art opening. You could also use this to tell guests about
registries for weddings.</span></p><h3><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small"><b>Paper
Options</b></span></h3><div><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small"><b><br></b></span></div><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/264/posts/20896/image/invitations-06.jpg"></figure><p>Special inserts,
like reply cards can come in all shapes, sizes and colors. The idea
here is not to overshadow the main invite, but compliment it.
Consider going with a smaller size so it fits nicely inside your
invite next to the reply card and envelope. Then choose a vellum
paper for something unique and print text and designs with a solid
color that goes with your overall design. You could also include a
blank vellum sheet, common in wedding invites. If you go with vellum,
keep in mind it's best to use simple text and illustrations for this
sheet. Full color photos won't print as well on translucent paper.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>

Theyâve each offered their own set of interesting features, appealing to specific sets of users, and unfortunately most of them have either disappeared or are no longer being actively developed.</p><p>Thatâs where <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> comes in. Itâs a cross-platform communication service established by the people that brought us Flickr back in the day, and it combines team chat with top-notch integrations with the other web apps your team is already using.</p><p>In this tutorial, Iâm going to give you a tour of its basic features and help you get started communicating better with your team.</p>

<h2>The Features</h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slack is.png"><figcaption>A promotional image from Slack.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Before I begin, Iâd like to explain the core features that Slack offers so you have a better idea of what you can do with a free account.</p>

<h3>Chat</h3>

<p>Slackâs main feature is instant messaging, which has been a great way to get in touch with people since the days of AOL. It works a bit like IRC, using channels preceded by a <strong>#</strong>&nbsp;as a way of organizing topics. You can also make your own private group and send private messages to a colleague to develop sinister secondary plans on the side of your day job.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>The second feature Slack sports is its search. If a few people within your team were talking about a project you needed finished tomorrow, you can quickly look through the history of your channels and find out if any progress has been made. Even better, Slackâs search is global, so it will show a private message between you and another team member as well as results in any channels you belong to. Search on free accounts is limited to the last 20,000 messages, but you can <a href="https://tutsapps.slack.com/pricing">upgrade to Standard</a> for $8 per user per month if you need unlimited access.</p>

<h3>Service Integrations</h3>

<p>Lastly, Slack is very proud of its ability to connect with other services your team uses every day. On its <a href="https://slack.com/integrations">Service Integrations page</a>, you can add anything from GoSquared and New Relic to Twitter and Trello. There are even custom slash commands and a full Slack API Integration for advanced users. The level of connection Slack offers to third-party tools is unparalleled.</p>

<h2>Signing Up</h2>

<p>Signing up for an account on Slack takes about five minutes. Hereâs the step-by-step rundown:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slack sign up completion.png"><figcaption>The sign up confirmation screen.</figcaption></figure>

<ol>
<li>Head to <a href="https://slack.com">Slackâs homepage</a> and input your email address and company name, then click <strong>Sign Up for Free</strong>. I suggest using your company email (a custom domain) if you have one because Slack will offer to add additional emails with that domain to your team automatically when they sign up.</li>
<li>Check your email for a message titled âInvitation to Slackâ. Within it, click the blue <strong>Set up your team now</strong> button to get started.</li>
<li>Youâll be asked if the email address youâre using is the right one. Click <strong>Yes, thatâs the right address</strong> if so; <strong>Switch to a different email</strong> will send a confirmation to a new address.</li>
<li>Next, choose assign a name to your team. It might be a group of writers, designers, or coders. When youâre finished, click <strong>Next</strong> and make a username for your account.</li>
<li>Choose a URL for your team. It will need to be something unique, because Slack gives you a subdomain on its website (your-team.slack.com). Click <strong>Next</strong> when youâre finished with that.</li>
<li>Conclude the setup process by adding your domain to the team settings. If youâd like to invite more people to your team, input their email addresses on the next screen.</li>
<li>If everything went according to plan, youâll now be redirected to the Slack Web app.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thatâs all there is to setting up a team on Slack. Now itâs time to start using the service.</p>

<h3>Inviting Team Members</h3>

<p>If you neglected to send them an email in the setup stage, now is still a good time to invite your team members to Slack. To do so, click the left arrow icon on the right side of the main Slack interface, select <strong>Team Directory</strong>, and click the <strong>Invite some</strong> link. Youâll be taken to the <strong>Send Invitations</strong> page. Enter as many email addresses as you want in the first field and channels in the second. Note that the <strong>general</strong> channel will be added by default. When youâre finished, click <strong>Send Invitations</strong> to dispatch emails to your team, which is most likely on the balcony having a party just to show how proud of you they are.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slack invitations.png"><figcaption>Making sure the usual folks are in my team.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Make sure to tell your team to check their emails, including their spam folders, for an invite to Slack.</p>

<h2>Conversations with Slackbot</h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slackbot setup.png"><figcaption>The witty Slackbot helps you get started.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Each user will be greeted with welcome tips when he first visits your team Slack. If you wish to opt out of them on a per-user basis, click the <strong>Opt out of these tips</strong> link at the bottom of one and theyâll leave you alone. Regardless of the annoyance factor, I recommend taking Slackâs guided tour to give you an idea how things work.</p>

<p>When youâve finished the little tour, youâll be informed about all the wonderful apps Slack offers. Then youâll see a small bubble beside <strong>Slackbot</strong> in the <strong>Direct Messages</strong> section of the sidebar. It will help you and other users set up a profile, beginning by asking your first name. You can reply and it will add it to your profile. The bot will continue to ask you various questions, like whether you wish to add your Skype username to your profile and if you have anyone else to invite to the team. All this takes about two minutes.</p>

<h2>Using Channels</h2>

<p>If youâre familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC technology</a>, channels may not be a new concept to you. In the context of Slack, Channels are used as a way to separate different topics â&nbsp;distinct chatrooms. You can use them to manage different projects within the same company, and you can always have <strong>#random</strong> sitting around just in case someone feels sociable.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Channel creation.png"><figcaption>Need a new channel? One click, two fields, one more click, and you've got it.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you have a lot of channels and always want one to be easily accessible, select it, hover over its name, and star it to put it at the top of your sidebar.</p>

<p>When you first set up Slack, youâll see two channels in the sidebar: <strong>general</strong> and <strong>random</strong>. You can add a new one by clicking the <strong>Create a channel</strong> link below the first two. When you do so, youâll be asked to give it a title and description. When youâre finished, click <strong>Create Channel</strong> and itâll be added to your teamâs channels. You can also create a <strong>Private Group</strong>, which will only be seen by team members with access. These members will also be the only ones who can search the group. This can be handy if you need digital walls between your cohorts.</p>

<h2>Getting Notified</h2>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Desktop notifications.png"><figcaption>Make your notifications custom.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now that you have grips with things, itâs a good idea to switch on notifications if you havenât already. Slack supports desktop notifications in the browser and its native apps. It also supports push notifications on iPhone and Android.</p>

<p>If youâre not getting alerts when someone mentions you in a channel, you may need to enable notifications. In the Mac and Web apps, you can do this by waiting for Slack to ask for permission or by heading to Safariâs <strong>Preferences</strong>, selecting <strong>Notifications</strong>, and switching the selection beside <em>team-name.slack.com</em> to <strong>Allow</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Mention someoneâs username in a channel and they will receive an alert by default.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Safari notifications.png"><figcaption>Allowing browser notifications in Safari is key to Slack's alerts working properly.</figcaption></figure>
<p>If Slackâs notifications are not enabled, you can fix that by clicking the <strong>^</strong> button beside your profile in the bottom left corner and selecting <strong>Preferences</strong>. In the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab, make sure one of the first two boxes under <strong>Desktop Notifications</strong> is highlighted. The first will send you a notification any time something happens in your channels, and the second will only send you one when youâve been mentioned or sent a direct message.</p>

<p>Should you want to keep up with certain terms in your channels, you can do so by adding them to the <strong>Highlight Words</strong> field, which will work if notifications are active. Each time this word is used in your channels, youâll be alerted on your devices.</p>

<p>Notifications can also be overridden on a per-channel basis. Clicking the down arrow beside the channel name will reveal a configuration menu. Select <strong>Channel notification preferences</strong> and youâll be able to override global notifications, with the exception of what Highlight Words to use.</p>

<h2>Integrating</h2>

<p>Say you want to quickly share some project drafts with your team. You could email them all the Dropbox link, or you could add the Dropbox integration to your Slack team. Google Drive is supported too if you prefer that. Even better, thereâs Pingdom integration if you want your Web developer team to know when your site goes down. It will send alerts to the entire channel and one of them can quickly respond to the issue. Another good usage case would be RSS for your team of journalists. If thereâs something new in the <em>Associated Press</em>â breaking section the channel will be alerted and you can begin reporting on it.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slack integration.png"><figcaption>You can connect a lot of different services to Slack to enhance your team's experience.</figcaption></figure>

<p>There are many ways you can use Slackâs Integrations to benefit your team â&nbsp;of course, I canât list them all. Rather than give you ideas of how to use Integrations, Iâll show you how to add one.</p>

<ol>
<li>In Slack, click the down arrow beside your channel name and select <strong>Add a service integration</strong>. Youâll be taken to a webpage.</li>
<li>Find an Integration that appeals to you and click the <strong>+ Service-Name</strong> button beside it. On the next page, you'll see a&nbsp;<b>Usage Guide</b>. I recommend clicking&nbsp;<b>Expand<i>&nbsp;</i></b>to understand what the Integration is capable of before adding it.<b></b></li>
<li>Setup depends on the service, but you will usually be asked what channel youâd like to add the Integration to, followed by authentication if youâre connecting Slack to an external account like Dropbox or Twitter.</li>
<li>When youâre finished, test your Integration to be sure it works properly.</li>
</ol><h3>Integrating Dropbox</h3><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Dropbox Page.png"><figcaption>Selecting Dropbox as an Integration.</figcaption></figure><p>Since file sharing Integrations in Slack are very similar, here's a good step-by-step example of setting one up and using it. I like Dropbox, so I opted to choose it for this example, but the steps and end functionality will be similar for Google Drive, Box, and others as well.<br></p><h4>Setup<br></h4><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slack Dropbox.png"><figcaption>Giving Slack permission to access files in Dropbox.</figcaption></figure><ol><li>As with any Integration, start by opening Slack. Once there, click the down arrow beside your channel name and select&nbsp;<strong>Add a service integration</strong>. Youâll be taken to a webpage.</li><li>Scroll down until you locate Dropbox and click the&nbsp;<b>+ Dropbox</b> button.</li><li>Click the&nbsp;<b></b>blue&nbsp;<b>Authenticate your Dropbox account</b> button in the <b>Authentication</b> section&nbsp;to begin the integration process.</li><li>You may be asked to sign in to your Dropbox account. If you're already signed in, click&nbsp;<b>Allow</b> to grant Slack access to your Dropbox files and folders. You'll be taken back to the Dropbox Integration page if this is successful.</li></ol><h4>Usage</h4><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Dropbox integration upload.png"><figcaption>Quickly importing a Dropbox file from inside Slack.</figcaption></figure><p>Now that you've successfully connected Dropbox to Slack, it's time to try it out. If you head back to one of your Slack channels and click the upload button to the left of the main text field, you'll see a new option:&nbsp;<b>Import from Dropbox</b>. Clicking it will open a <b>Dropbox Chooser</b> window, allowing you to select a file to upload from your Dropbox account. Select as many files as you wish and click&nbsp;<b>Choose</b> to bring them into Slack.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Dropbox comment.png"><figcaption>Commenting on a file.</figcaption></figure><p>Once a file is imported, you'll be asked to give it a title â if the original isn't descriptive enough â and description â optional. It will then be posted in the active channel for the rest of your team to see. Now there are a few actions that can be taken:</p><ul><li><b></b><b>Open it</b>. You can open the file in Dropbox to view it by clicking its title and selecting <b>Open in Dropbox</b> from the&nbsp;<b>Flexpane&nbsp;</b>(the left arrow in the top right of the screen)&nbsp;menu.</li><li><b>Comments</b>. Your team will be able to comment on files you've uploaded by either selecting its title or opening the <b>Flexpane</b>&nbsp;and selecting it.&nbsp;<br></li><li><b>Search</b>. Dropbox and all other Integrations are fully connected to Slack's search functionality, which means you can find those files even when you thought they were long gone. If you deleted them from your Dropbox, though, they are long gone.<br></li><li><b>Refresh file contents</b>. When you have the file selected in the <b>Flexpane</b>, you can make sure it's up to date in Slack by clicking the&nbsp;<b>Refresh file contents</b> link.<br></li><li><b>Sharing</b>. Dropbox files can be shared with specific team members after you've imported them to a channel. Simply click the&nbsp;<b>Share</b> link and choose&nbsp;<b>Share with a person&nbsp;</b>in the&nbsp;<b>Share with</b> drop-down menu. You can add a brief comment as well. Click&nbsp;<b>Share&nbsp;</b>when you're finished.<br></li><li><b>Removal</b>. You can remove a Dropbox import from a channel by clicking the&nbsp;<b>â</b> button to the right of the channel name. You can also remove it from Slack by clicking the red&nbsp;<b>Delete from Slack<i></i></b> link in the&nbsp;<b>Flexpane</b>.<br></li></ul>

<h2>Searching</h2><p>The last of Slack's headlining functions is search. The developers are very proud of this one, because once you integrate something with Slack, you can search through the files you've uploaded, Tweets that have been posted in Slack, Trello projects that are active, and messages sent by specific team members.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slack search.png"><figcaption>Searching for some camera goodness posted our fair editor.</figcaption></figure><p>If your team has been working on a specific project for the past few days, but you've been out of the office, search is the perfect way to get back into things, so long as they've been using Slack to collaborate. You can search for terms related to the project by clicking the&nbsp;<b>Search</b> field and typing. No need to press enter â it's instant.</p><p>Search results will be displayed in the&nbsp;<b>Flexpane</b>, and there are a few ways to filter them if you click the&nbsp;<b>+ More Options&nbsp;</b>button. Note that these options work for both the&nbsp;<b>Messages</b> and <b>Files&nbsp;</b>tabs.</p><ul><li><b>By user</b>. By default, search will go through messages posted by&nbsp;<b>Everyone</b>. You can quickly change this to yourself by clicking the&nbsp;<b>Just You</b> button in the <b>Flexpane</b>. If you want to see what another team member has been saying, click the down arrow to the right of&nbsp;<b>Just You</b> and select his name. You can also search for it. Despite usernames being displayed, inserting a full name will display the users with that assigned to their profile.</li><li><b>Time or relevance</b>. Selecting&nbsp;<b>Most Recent</b> will display the newest messages or files matching your search;&nbsp;<b>Most Relevant&nbsp;</b>will display what Slack believes to be the more applicable ones.<br></li><li><b>Channel and group</b>. By default, search will display results from&nbsp;<b>All channels</b>, but you can change it by selecting the drop-down menu beside&nbsp;<b>Channel</b> and choosing a one you'd like to search. The same goes for groups.<br></li><li><b>Limiting</b>. Checking the box beside&nbsp;<b>Limit</b> will restrict search results to the channels and groups you have open right now.<br></li></ul><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slack search.png"><figcaption>More camera discussion on the left with some home screens to the right.</figcaption></figure><p>All search results are expandable, so even though it may look like there's one message related to what you searched for, you can click it to see it in context: two messages before and after. Also, selecting&nbsp;<b>Jump</b> will move your main feed to the result.<b> </b>The date button&nbsp;<b><i></i></b>will bring you back in time, directing you to that time in the channel's Slack archive.<b></b></p><h2>Going Mobile</h2>

<p>Before I finish things up, thereâs one more important bit of Slack I havenât gotten to yet: Mobile. When youâre on the go, attending meetings, getting coffee, and flying on Flight 815, it might be a good idea to check in with your team and see how theyâre doing. Slackâs interface is so consistent across platforms that getting started on a mobile device will be natural. For this quick mobile section, Iâll be using an iPhone.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21327/image/Slack iPhone.jpg"><figcaption>Slack's iPhone app. And yes, this is my real account.</figcaption></figure><p>When you download the iPhone app, youâll be welcomed and quickly shown the features available. Swipe left twice to the <strong>Get Started</strong> screen and tap <strong>Sign In</strong>. Enter the email you used to set up Slack and tap <strong>Retrieve Account</strong>. Tap the site you wish to sign in to, enter your password, and behold â&nbsp;Slack has been set up on your iPhone. You may also want to enable push notifications when the app asks you to.<br></p>

<p>To access your Channels, swipe right; to access your files and settings, swipe left. Everything else is basically the same as the desktop apps. There are some things you canât access, like channel settings, but the mobile app should be sufficient in helping you stay connected with your team on the road.</p>

<h2>Beyond the Slackerâs Guide</h2>

<p>Slack is a service of limitless possibilities. The developers are dedicated to keeping it up to date with the latest and greatest technology, and the Web app is the best available for the job. Now that you have an idea of what you can do with Slack, it may be worth taking things a bit further with advanced Integrations and multiple channels to accommodate your ever-growing team. Remember, you can do a lot of stuff for free, so donât get in a hurry to upgrade your account.</p>

<p>You should now have a solid grasp on setting up an account with Slack, getting your team connected, and managing things while in the office and on the go. Now, go get some work done.</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21327/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21327/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21327/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21327/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T08:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-17T08:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>With the <b>Base Body dress</b> mesh selected, turn on its
<i>visibility</i> in the outliner panel.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(1).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3>

<br>

<p>With the
dress mesh selected, <b>Scale</b> it up a little bit using the&nbsp;<b>S</b> key.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(2).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Now keep
only the <b>Base Body Dress</b> mesh visible
and turn <i>Off</i> the visibility for the rest of the meshes, so we can concentrate
on modeling the dress.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(3).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><br>

<p>In the <b>Front</b> view, select the cloth mesh and then press <b>Z</b>&nbsp;for wireframe mode. Enter&nbsp;<b>Face</b>
selection mode, select one half of the mesh and then press the&nbsp;<b>Delete</b> key, to delete the selected
faces.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(4).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3>

<br>

<p>With the sleeve border selected, <b>Extrude</b> it once as shown in the following image.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(5).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 6</h3>

<br>

<p>With the
half dress mesh still selected, click on the&nbsp;<b>Modifier</b>
button and then apply the&nbsp;<b>Mirror</b>
modifier.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(6).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 7</h3>

<br>

<p>While in <b>Face</b> selection mode, select the <b>3</b> indicated faces around the breast area and
then press <b>Delete</b>,&nbsp;to delete the selected
faces.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(7).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 8</h3>

<br>

<p>We deleted
the cleavage faces because we have to modify the chest mesh into cloth. So
adjust the vertices around the cleavage area as if cloth on the body.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(8).jpg"></figure>

<h3>Step 9</h3><br>

<p>In the same way, we need to reduce the details around the abdomen area to make it look
like cloth.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(9).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 10</h3><p>With the indicated edges selected, press <b>X</b>&nbsp;and choose the&nbsp;<b>Dissolve</b>
command to delete only the selected edges, and not the faces.

</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(10).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 11</h3>

<br>

<p>After dissolving the edges, jump into <b>Vertex</b> selection mode and you
will see some unnecessary vertices left on the edges. So with these unnecessary
vertices selected, press <b>X</b> again and choose the&nbsp;<b>Dissolve</b> command to delete the
selected vertices, but not the faces.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(11).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 12</h3><p>After
dissolving the edges and unnecessary vertices, you can see the simplified
mesh that will be used as cloth. However we need to tweak it a little bit more. 

</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(12).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 13</h3><br>

<p>Switch to <b>Face</b> selection mode, and select the indicated faces shown in the image
below. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(13).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 14</h3>

<br>

<p><b>Delete</b> these selected faces.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(14).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 15</h3><p>Now <i>unhide
</i>the body mesh so that we can easily offset the cloth mesh vertices in
<b>Vertex</b> selection mode. 

</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(15).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 16</h3><br>

<p>Select
the bottom edge ring and then click on the&nbsp;<b>Subdivide</b>
tool, to add edges to the loop.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(16).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 17</h3>

<br>

<p>After subdividing the faces, arrange the bottom row faces as shown in the
image below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(17).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 18</h3>

<br>

<p>With the faces selected, use the&nbsp;<b>E</b>
key to <b>Extrude</b>&nbsp;them once.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(18).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 19</h3>

<br>

<p>Now select
the inner border edge loop as shown in the image below.&nbsp; </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(19).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 20</h3>

<br>

<p>With the
border edge loop selected, <b>Extrude</b> it twice as shown in the following image.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(20).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 21</h3>

<br>

<p>Adjust the
vertices accordingly. You can keep extruding until you get the length you want. In this
way, we complete the base cloth mesh of the character. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(21).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 22</h3>

<br>

<p>Before
moving ahead, do count the number of border vertices for equal and parallel
connecting, so we can subdivide and increase the edges equally and
accordingly.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/A(22).jpg"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">2.</span> Adding Detail to the Cloth</h2><h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Now letâs
add details to the skirt. First select the last two rows of faces as shown in
the image below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/B(1).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3>

<br>

<p>With the
faces selected, press <b>Shift-D</b> to duplicate them and separate the mesh. Also Scale them down a bit.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/B(2).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>With the
same faces selected, press <b>E</b>&nbsp;to extrude.
We need this extrusion to add extra detail to the skirt.

</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/B(3).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><br>

<p>Next, select
the indicated border faces of the collar shown below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/B(4).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3>

<br>

<p>With the
collar faces selected, use <b>E</b>&nbsp;to
<b>Extrude</b> the faces once. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/B(5).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 6</h3>

<br>

<p>Following
the same process, <b>Extrude</b> the sleeve border faces as well. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/B(6).jpg"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">3.</span> Making the Socks</h2><h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Now, <i>hide</i>
all the meshes except for the socks and the dress. &nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/C(1).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3>

<br>

<p>In the
<b>Face</b> selection mode, select the faces of either the left or right sock. Here
we have to create a mirrored mesh as an instance for editing.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/C(2).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3>

<br>

<p>With the
faces selected, press <b>X</b>&nbsp;and choose <b>Faces</b> from the fly-out
menu to delete the selected faces.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/C(3).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3>

<br>

<p>Now
with the rest of the sock selected, open the&nbsp;<b>Modifier</b>
panel and click on the&nbsp;<b>Mirror </b>modifier
in the list. This will create an instanced copy of the sock on the opposite side. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/C(4).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3>

<br>

<p>Now with
every alternate top vertice selected, move them a bit upward to create the
design of the socks.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/C(5).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 6</h3>

<br>

<p>Also <i>unhide</i> the
body mesh and then arrange and offset the sock's vertices accordingly. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/C(6).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 7</h3>

<br>

<p><b>Delete</b> the
toes to make it look more like a sock.</p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/C(7).jpg"><h3>Step 8</h3><br>

<p>Also adjust
the vertices of the socks around the toe part, so that it looks like a

<br>

<p>You can now see
how the socks look like.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/C(9).jpg"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">4.</span> Subdividing the Mesh</h2><h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Letâs add
detail to the skirt. Select the indicated border edge loop as shown in the
image below. &nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/D(1).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>With the
edges selected, first click on the <b>Subdivide</b> tool button and keep the <b>Number of Cuts</b> set to&nbsp;<b>2</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/D(2).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3>

the same process, select the faces of the lower part and use the&nbsp;<b>Extrude Individual</b> tool again.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/D(13).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 14</h3>

<p>Also select
and <b>Extrude</b> the bottom faces by using the same <b>Extrude
Individual</b> tool.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/D(14).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 15</h3>

<p>In this way
we have completed the skirt design. You can see how it looks below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/D(15).jpg"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">5.</span> Increasing Subdivision for Sculpting</h2><h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Now letâs
start sculpting the cloth mesh. But before we do that, we need to increase the
subdivision of the mesh as sculpting demands a highly subdivided mesh. Here we use the&nbsp;<b>Loop Cut and Slide</b> tool
to add subdivision, as shown in the image below. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(1).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>In this way, we have subdivided the cloth mesh for detailed sculpting using the&nbsp;<b>Loop Cut and Slide</b> tool.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(2).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Increase the subdivision level by applying the&nbsp;<b>Subdivide</b>
modifier with the&nbsp;<b>Subdivision</b> <b>View</b> value set to<b> 3</b>. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(3).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>Now with the
cloth mesh selected, choose <b>Sculpt Mode</b>
as shown in the image below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(4).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3>

<p>First
select the&nbsp;<b>F</b> <b>Smooth</b> brush from the <b>Brush Selection</b> panel, as shown in the image below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(5).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 6</h3>

<p>With the <b>F Smooth</b> brush selected, you can set the brush's&nbsp;<b>Radius</b> and <b>Strength</b> values as needed.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(6).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 7</h3>

<p>Use the <b>Smooth</b> brush to make the mesh surface smooth where required.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(7).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 8</h3>

<p>Now, for asymmetrical sculpting on the cloth mesh, we need to merge the mirrored
parts. So, with the cloth mesh selected, turn on <b>Object Mode</b>. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(8).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 9</h3>

<p>Go to the&nbsp;<b>Modifier</b> panel, keep the <b>View</b> value at <b>0</b> and then click on the&nbsp;<b>Apply</b> button to merge the mirrored
meshes.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(9).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 10</h3>

<p>After that, with the cloth mesh selected, turn on <b>Edit Mode</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(10).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 11</h3>

<p>After
merging, there may be some unmerged vertices. So with the mutual corresponding vertices
selected, press <b>Alt-M</b>&nbsp;and
select the&nbsp;<b>At Center</b> option from the fly-out menu.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(11).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 12</h3>

<p>After merging the vertices, turn on <b>Sculpting
Mode</b> with a&nbsp;<b>View</b> value of&nbsp;<b>3.</b>&nbsp;Begin sculpting the cloth
mesh to add more details, like wrinkles and creases. </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(12).jpg"></figure><h3>Step 13</h3>

<p>In this way, sculpt on the mesh to show wrinkles and crease
on the cloth. You can play with the sculpting tools to get a different and more
detailed look.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/168/posts/21357/image/E(13).jpg"></figure><h2>Conclusion</h2>
