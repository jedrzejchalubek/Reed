In this article, you'll learn a few tips that can help you avoid some of the pitfalls and grow your game development business.</p>
<h2>Building Your ​Portfolio</h2><p>Your portfolio determines whether you'll​ be hired for a job. Include everything you are proud of in your portfolio: student projects, community projects (yes, branch those open source projects), previous work experience, hobby projects, past client work, and anything else. But make sure you only put work you are <i>proud of</i> on your portfolio! You are only as good as what your portfolio shows to people who don't know you in person.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, looks are important. We live in a fast-paced, instagram​, snapchatting world where no one has time for anything, let alone words and descriptions. When potential customers have 100 portfolios to read through in two days, visuals are going to count quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>What if you are a programmer? Make your code and projects easy to read and easy to understand for non-technical customers. Link to your GitHub portfolios; GitHub's clean interface works to your advantage (and make sure you have nicely written <code class="inline">README.md</code> files with clear context and descriptions for each project).&nbsp;</p><p>The people ​making hiring decisions​ are frequently not the tech leads, but rather the producers, who may or may not have a technical background. It is your job to make sure your portfolio is as easy to grasp as possible for the client in ​just ​a few minutes.</p>
<h2>Building Trust</h2><p>Trust is crucial to the success of your client service business. You need the clients to trust that you have the ability to finish the project, trust that you are billing them correctly, trust that you are putting the right people on the project, and trust that you are building something solid underneath the surface.</p>
<p>​This is similar to hiring a babysitter​, from the client's perspective; you've got this ​seed of an idea and you want it to be amazing and to blossom, and you are trusting someone else to help you get there. When the client hands the project over to you, they are ​in​ a very vulnerable position. What if you take the project and run away with it? What if you deliver something that ​isn't what you've promised​?​ What if you've stolen art assets or other people's copyrighted work? It is scary hiring someone else to work on your valuable ideas and projects, and that's why trust is critical to your success.</p>
<p>For people outside of your personal network, how do you build trust? The strength of your portfolio will help, but trust is built on soft skills. There are two ways to build ​trust:&nbsp;</p><p>First, you can build trust through all your communication with a potential customer from the very beginning, be it ​via ​email, on the phone, or in person. You have to be professional and genuine—the latter ​is ​especially important—and you have to be able to show what you know without coming across as ​egotistic, and show warmth​. ​</p><figure><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ks-_Mh1QhMc" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0"></iframe><figcaption>I recommend you watch this TED Talk by Amy Cuddy.</figcaption></figure><p>Trust is often built in the blink of an eye (for more on this, read&nbsp;<a href="http://gladwell.com/blink/" rel="external" target="_blank">Blink</a>) and continuous improvements in personal communication will help—so start toda​y​!</p>
<p>Second, ​trust can be built ​through word of mouth and your reputation. If you are already vetted by someone the client trusts, you are half way ​to getting the project. Give talks at conferences (start small and local if you can), write articles, help other developers out, and get involved in community work: find your local IGDA or game developer communities, or start one ​yourself.</p>
<p>The best type of clients are repeat clients—people who love your work and trust that you have their best interests at heart​. Occasionally, you'll have to take a financial loss​ to maintain a good relationship or to repair trust with a client; just know that nothing is more valuable than ​holding their ​trust in the long run. Plenty of people will pay a premium to work with someone they can trust, but no one will hire someone whom they can't trust, no matter how much cheaper it is.</p>
<h2>Building Expertise</h2><p>Potential customers need to know that you know your stuff. You can show this in your portfolio, your blog posts, and your pet projects, but the most effective way to do this is by giving talks and publishing books.&nbsp;</p><p>Ask community organizers for talk opportunities; propose a talk on a topic that you are interested in and that is unique. I organize a <a href="http://meetup.com/Seattle-Unity3D/" rel="external" target="_blank">developer community</a>, and I am always looking for people to come talk to the group, so you'll be doing the organizer a favor by reaching out.&nbsp;</p><p>As for books, there are many ways you can get published (including ebooks and self-pub​l​i​s​hing). Don't expect huge profits from your books, but being able to talk about a particular topic for pages shows expertise and dedication—two important aspects when people are looking for help.</p>
<h2>Building Testimonials</h2><p>How do you build a sustainable business if you are always working on other people's intellectual portfolio? By building your portfolio, building your network, and building your testimonials.&nbsp;</p><p>Think of testimonials as word-of-mouth from someone you don't know; it's the closest second to being vetted by a trusted common friend. After each successful project, ask your clients if they can give you a testimonial, and also be sure to ask how you could​ further improve.&nbsp;</p><p>When a client writes you a testimonial, it also further strengthens your relationship with the client (building potential for repeat work), and acts as further social proof for trust with new customers.​ Asking for feedback ​also helps you grow as a studio and improve on your next project.</p>
<h2>A Note on Getting Paid</h2><p>Getting paid isn't always as straightforward as it should be. First thing's first: in your contract, make sure you have a clause that says unless you are fully paid, the IP remains with you (check with your legal counsel on this). The last payment is often the hardest to get, because once you've finished the project, there's little reason for the client to pay you as quickly as they should. Make sure this is in writing to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Pay attention to payment terms. We used to do 30-day terms (meaning the client has up to 30 days to pay once we invoice them). But the problem is, we pay the team much earlier than that, and this 30-day difference puts a lot of risk and financial burden on the company, so ​we were constantly dealing with negative cash flow every beginning of the month.&nbsp;</p><p>Also communicate with your clients to find out when their accounts payable process invoices—this can come in handy for you to schedule the invoices at the right time so you don't miss their payment cycle.​ Aim to make it easy for them and they'll thank you for it, and you'll get paid.​</p>
<p>If you have worked with a repeat customer for some time, you can negotiate a <i>retainer</i>, which is an upfront payment for a fixed amount of time to work on their projects each month. This is a great setup for both sides, as you​'ll​ get cash upfront (<a href="http://beginnersinvest.about.com/od/analyzingabalancesheet/a/negative-working-capital.htm" rel="external" target="_blank">negative working capital</a>) and the client will know that you'​ll​ reserve a certain amount of time for their projects. Retainers require a lot of trust, but they can simplify things and be hugely beneficial to all involved.​ Just be sure that the retainer covers all of your billable hours, or you'll end up spending more time on a project and lose out financially.​</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><p>​For three years now, my company has worked on both client projects and our ​own IPs​. Client work has allowed us to stay independent and survive in ​an industry that's going through continuous changes. Despite some of the challenges it presents and the learning curve that’s involved, ​it’s one of the most reliable ways to fund your game studio, work on cool ideas and projects you wouldn't get to otherwise, grow your skillset, and meet lots of great people!</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21081/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21081/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21081/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21081/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-14T15:49:04.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-14T15:49:04.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

It comes with Models, Collections, Views, Events, Router and a few other great features. In this article we will develop a simple ToDo application which supports adding, editing, and removing tasks. We should also be able to mark a task as <em>done</em> and archive it. In order to keep this post's length reasonable, we will not include any communication with a database. All the data will be kept on the client-side.<br></p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Here is the file structure which we'll use:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">css
    └── styles.css
js
    └── collections
        └── ToDos.js
    └── models
        └── ToDo.js
    └── vendor
       └── backbone.js
       └── jquery-1.10.2.min.js
       └── underscore.js
    └── views
    └── App.js
 └── index.html
</pre>

<p>There are few things which are obvious, like <code>/css/styles.css</code> and <code>/index.html</code>. They contain the CSS styles and the HTML markup. In the context of Backbone.js, the model is a place where we keep our data. So, our ToDos will simply be models. And because we will have more than one task, we will organize them into a collection. The business logic is distributed between the views and the main application's file, <code>App.js</code>. Backbone.js has only one hard dependency - <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a>. The framework also plays very well with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, so they both go to the <code>vendor</code> directory. All we need now is just a little HTML markup and we are ready to go.</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My TODOs&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css" /&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
            &lt;div id="menu" class="menu cf"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/vendor/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/vendor/underscore.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/vendor/backbone.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/App.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/models/ToDo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/collections/ToDos.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            window.onload = function() {
                // bootstrap
            }
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>As you can see, we are including all the external JavaScript files towards the bottom, as it's a good practice to do this at the end of the body tag. We are also preparing the bootstrapping of the application. There is container for the content, a menu and a title. The main navigation is a static element and we are not going to change it. We will replace the content of the title and the <code>div</code> below it.</p>

<h2>Planning the Application</h2>

<p>It's always good to have a plan before we start working on something. Backbone.js doesn't have a super strict architecture, which we have to follow. That's one of the benefits of the framework. So, before we start with the implementation of the business logic, let's talk about the basis.</p>

<h3>Namespacing</h3>

<p>A good practice is to put your code into its own scope. Registering global variables or functions is not a good idea. What we will create is one model, one collection, a router and few Backbone.js views. All these elements should live in a private space. <code>App.js</code> will contain the class which holds everything.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// App.js
var app = (function() {

    var api = {
        views: {},
        models: {},
        collections: {},
        content: null,
        router: null,
        todos: null,
        init: function() {
            this.content = $("#content");
        },
        changeContent: function(el) {
            this.content.empty().append(el);
            return this;
        },
        title: function(str) {
            $("h1").text(str);
            return this;
        }
    };
    var ViewsFactory = {};
    var Router = Backbone.Router.extend({});
    api.router = new Router();

    return api;

})();
</pre>

<p>Above is a typical implementation of the <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript">revealing module pattern</a>. The <code>api</code> variable is the object which is returned and represents the public methods of the class. The <code>views</code>, <code>models</code> and <code>collections</code> properties will act as holders for the classes returned by Backbone.js. The <code>content</code> is a jQuery element pointing to the main user's interface container. There are two helper methods here. The first one updates that container. The second one sets the page's title. Then we defined a module called <code>ViewsFactory</code>. It will deliver our views and at the end, we created the router.</p>

<p>You may ask, why do we need a factory for the views? Well, there are some common patterns while working with Backbone.js. One of them is related to the creation and usage of the views.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">var ViewClass = Backbone.View.extend({ /* logic here */ });
var view = new ViewClass();
</pre>

<p>It's good to initialize the views only once and leave them alive. Once the data is changed, we normally call methods of the view and update the content of its <code>el</code> object. The other very popular approach, is to recreate the whole view or replace the whole DOM element. However, that's not really good from a performance point of view. So, we normally end up with a utility class which creates one instance of the view and returns it when we need it.</p>

<h3>Components Definition</h3>

<p>We have a namespace, so now we can start creating components. Here is how the main menu looks:</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// views/menu.js
app.views.menu = Backbone.View.extend({
    initialize: function() {},
    render: function() {}
});
</pre>

<p>We created a property called <code>menu</code> which holds the class of the navigation. Later, we may add a method in the factory module which creates an instance of it.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">var ViewsFactory = {
    menu: function() {
        if(!this.menuView) {
            this.menuView = new api.views.menu({ 
                el: $("#menu")
            });
        }
        return this.menuView;
    }
};
</pre>

<p>Above is how we will handle all of the views, and it will ensure that we get only one and of the same instance. This technique works well, in most cases.</p>

<h3>Flow</h3>

<p>The entry point of the app is <code>App.js</code> and its <code>init</code> method. This is what we will call in the <code>onload</code> handler of the <code>window</code> object.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">window.onload = function() {
    app.init();
}
</pre>

<p>After that, the defined router takes control. Based on the URL, it decides which handler to execute. In Backbone.js, we don't have the usual Model-View-Controller architecture. The Controller is missing and most of the logic is put into the views. So instead, we wire the models directly to methods, inside the views and get an instant update of the user interface, once the data has changed.</p>

<h2>Managing the Data</h2>

<p>The most important thing in our small project is the data. Our tasks are what we should manage, so let's start from there. Here is our model definition.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// models/ToDo.js
app.models.ToDo = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        title: "ToDo",
        archived: false,
        done: false
    }
});
</pre>

<p>Just three fields. The first one contains the text of the task and the other two are flags which define the status of the record.</p>

<p>Every thing inside the framework is actually an event dispatcher. And because the model is changed with setters, the framework knows when the data is updated and can notify the rest of the system for that. Once you bind something to these notifications, your application will react on the changes in the model. This is a really powerful feature in Backbone.js.</p>

<p>As I said in the beginning, we will have many records and we will organize them into a collection called <code>ToDos</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// collections/ToDos.js
app.collections.ToDos = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    initialize: function(){
        this.add({ title: "Learn JavaScript basics" });
        this.add({ title: "Go to backbonejs.org" });
        this.add({ title: "Develop a Backbone application" });
    },
    model: app.models.ToDo
    up: function(index) {
        if(index &gt; 0) {
            var tmp = this.models[index-1];
            this.models[index-1] = this.models[index];
            this.models[index] = tmp;
            this.trigger("change");
        }
    },
    down: function(index) {
        if(index &lt; this.models.length-1) {
            var tmp = this.models[index+1];
            this.models[index+1] = this.models[index];
            this.models[index] = tmp;
            this.trigger("change");
        }
    },
    archive: function(archived, index) {
        this.models[index].set("archived", archived);
    },
    changeStatus: function(done, index) {
        this.models[index].set("done", done);
    }
});
</pre>

<p>The  <code>initialize</code> method is the entry point of the collection. In our case, we added a few tasks by default. Of course in the real world, the information will come from a database or somewhere else. But to keep you focused, we will do that manually. The other thing which is typical for collections, is setting the <code>model</code> property. It tells the class what kind of data is being stored. The rest of the methods implement custom logic, related to the features in our application. <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> functions change the order of the ToDos. To simplify things, we will identify every ToDo with just an index in the collection's array. This means that if we want to fetch one specific record, we should point to its index. So, the ordering is just switching the elements in an array. As you may guess from the code above, <code>this.models</code> is the array which we are talking about. <code>archive</code> and <code>changeStatus</code> set properties of the given element. We put these methods here, because the views will have access to the <code>ToDos</code> collection and not to the tasks directly.</p>

<p>Additionally, we don't need to create any models from the <code>app.models.ToDo</code> class, but we do need to create an instance from the <code>app.collections.ToDos</code> collection.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// App.js
init: function() {
    this.content = $("#content");
    this.todos = new api.collections.ToDos();
    return this;
}
</pre>

<h2>Showing Our First View (Main Navigation)</h2>

<p>The first thing which we have to show, is the main application's navigation.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// views/menu.js
app.views.menu = Backbone.View.extend({
    template: _.template($("#tpl-menu").html()),
    initialize: function() {
        this.render();
    },
    render: function(){
        this.$el.html(this.template({}));
    }
});
</pre>

<p>It's only nine lines of code, but lots of cool things are happening here. The first one is setting a template. If you remember, we added Underscore.js to our app? We are going to use its templating engine, because it works good and it is simple enough to use. </p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">_.template(templateString, [data], [settings])
</pre>

<p>What you have at the end, is a function which accepts an object holding your information in key-value pairs and the <code>templateString</code> is HTML markup. Ok, so it accepts an HTML string, but what is <code>$("#tpl-menu").html()</code> doing there? When we are developing a small single page application, we normally put the templates directly into the page like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">// index.html
&lt;script type="text/template" id="tpl-menu"&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#archive"&gt;Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class="right"&gt;&lt;a href="#new"&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>And because it's a script tag, it is not shown to the user. From another point of view, it is a valid DOM node so we could get its content with jQuery. So, the short snippet above just takes the content of that script tag. </p>

<p>The <code>render</code> method is really important in Backbone.js. That's the function which displays the data. Normally you bind the events fired by the models directly to that method. However, for the main menu, we don't need such behavior.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">this.$el.html(this.template({}));
</pre>

<p><code>this.$el</code> is an object created by the framework and every view has it by default (there is a <code>$</code> infront of <code>el</code> because we have jQuery included). And by default, it is an empty <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>. Of course you may change that by using the <code>tagName</code> property. But what is more important here, is that we are not assigning a value to that object directly. We are not changing it, we are changing only its content. There is a big difference between the line above and this next one:</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">this.$el = $(this.template({}));
</pre>

<p>The point is, that if you want to see the changes in the browser you should call the render method before, to append the view to the DOM. Otherwise only the empty div will be attached. There is also another scenario where you have nested views. And because you are changing the property directly, the parent component is not updated. The bound events may also be broken and you need to attach the listeners again. So, you really should only change the content of <code>this.$el</code> and not the property's value.</p>

<p>The view is now ready and we need to initialize it. Let's add it to our factory module:</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// App.js
var ViewsFactory = {
    menu: function() {
        if(!this.menuView) {
            this.menuView = new api.views.menu({ 
                el: $("#menu")
            });
        }
        return this.menuView;
    }
};
</pre>

<p>At the end simply call the <code>menu</code> method in the bootstrapping area:</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// App.js
init: function() {
    this.content = $("#content");
    this.todos = new api.collections.ToDos();
    ViewsFactory.menu();
    return this;
}
</pre>

<p>Notice that while we are creating a new instance from the navigation's class, we are passing an already existing DOM element <code>$("#menu")</code>. So, the <code>this.$el</code> property inside the view is actually pointing to <code>$("#menu")</code>.</p>

<h2>Adding Routes</h2>

<p>Backbone.js supports the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history"><em>push state</em></a> operations. In other words, you may manipulate the current browser's URL and travel between pages. However, we'll stick with the good old hash type URLs, for example <code>/#edit/3</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// App.js
var Router = Backbone.Router.extend({
    routes: {
        "archive": "archive",
        "new": "newToDo",
        "edit/:index": "editToDo",
        "delete/:index": "delteToDo",
        "": "list"
    },
    list: function(archive) {},
    archive: function() {},
    newToDo: function() {},
    editToDo: function(index) {},
    delteToDo: function(index) {}
});
</pre>

<p>Above is our router. There are five routes defined in a hash object. The key is what you will type in the browser's address bar and the value is the function which will be called. Notice that there is <code>:index</code> on two of the routes. That's the syntax which you need to use if you want to support dynamic URLs. In our case, if you type <code>#edit/3</code> the <code>editToDo</code> will be executed with parameter <code>index=3</code>. The last row contains an empty string which means that it handles the home page of our application.</p>

<h2>Showing a List of All the Tasks</h2>

<p>So far what we've built is the main view for our project. It will retrieve the data from the collection and print it out on the screen. We could use the same view for two things - displaying all the active ToDos and showing those which are archived. </p>

<p>Before to continue with the list view implementation, let's see how it is actually initialized.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// in App.js views factory
list: function() {
    if(!this.listView) {
        this.listView = new api.views.list({
            model: api.todos
        });
    }   
    return this.listView;
}
</pre>

<p>Notice that we are passing in the collection. That's important because we will later use <code>this.model</code> to access the stored data. The factory returns our list view, but the router is the guy who has to add it to the page.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// in App.js's router
list: function(archive) {
    var view = ViewsFactory.list();
    api
    .title(archive ? "Archive:" : "Your ToDos:")
    .changeContent(view.$el);
    view.setMode(archive ? "archive" : null).render();
}
</pre>

<p>For now, the method <code>list</code> in the router is called without any parameters. So the view is not in <code>archive</code> mode, it will show only the active ToDos.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// views/list.js
app.views.list = Backbone.View.extend({
    mode: null,
    events: {},
    initialize: function() {
        var handler = _.bind(this.render, this);
        this.model.bind('change', handler);
        this.model.bind('add', handler);
        this.model.bind('remove', handler);
    },
    render: function() {},
    priorityUp: function(e) {},
    priorityDown: function(e) {},
    archive: function(e) {},
    changeStatus: function(e) {},
    setMode: function(mode) {
        this.mode = mode;
        return this;
    }
});
</pre>

<p>The <code>mode</code> property will be used during the rendering. If its value is <code>mode="archive"</code> then only the archived ToDos will be shown. The <code>events</code> is an object which we will fill right away. That's the place where we place the DOM events mapping. The rest of the methods are responses of the user interaction and they are directly linked to the needed features. For example, <code>priorityUp</code> and <code>priorityDown</code> changes the ordering of the ToDos. <code>archive</code> moves the item to the archive area. <code>changeStatus</code> simply marks the ToDo as done.</p>

<p>It's interesting what is happening inside the <code>initialize</code> method. Earlier we said that normally you will bind the changes in the model (the collection in our case) to the <code>render</code> method of the view. You may type <code>this.model.bind('change', this.render)</code>. But very soon you will notice that the <code>this</code> keyword, in the <code>render</code> method will not point to the view itself. That's because the scope is changed. As a workaround, we are creating a handler with an already defined scope. That's what Underscore's <code>bind</code> function is used for. </p>

<p>And here is the implementation of the <code>render</code> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// views/list.js
render: function() {)
    var html = '&lt;ul class="list"&gt;', 
        self = this;
    this.model.each(function(todo, index) {
        if(self.mode === "archive" ? todo.get("archived") === true : todo.get("archived") === false) {
            var template = _.template($("#tpl-list-item").html());
            html += template({ 
                title: todo.get("title"),
                index: index,
                archiveLink: self.mode === "archive" ? "unarchive" : "archive",
                done: todo.get("done") ? "yes" : "no",
                doneChecked: todo.get("done")  ? 'checked=="checked"' : ""
            });
        }
    });
    html += '&lt;/ul&gt;';
    this.$el.html(html);
    this.delegateEvents();
    return this;
}
</pre>

<p>We are looping through all the models in the collection and generating an HTML string, which is later inserted into the view's DOM element. There are few checks which distinguish the ToDos from archived to active. The task is marked as <em>done</em> with the help of a checkbox. So, to indicate this we need to pass a <code>checked=="checked"</code> attribute to that element. You may notice that we are using <code>this.delegateEvents()</code>. In our case this is necessary, because we are detaching and attaching the view from the DOM. Yes, we are not replacing the main element, but the events' handlers are removed. That's why we have to tell Backbone.js to attach them again. The template used in the code above is:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">// index.html
&lt;script type="text/template" id="tpl-list-item"&gt;
    &lt;li class="cf done-&lt;%= done %&gt;" data-index="&lt;%= index %&gt;"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;input type="checkbox" data-status &lt;%= doneChecked %&gt; /&gt;
            &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);" data-up&gt;&amp;#8593;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);" data-down&gt;&amp;#8595;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;%= title %&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;div class="options"&gt;
            &lt;a href="#edit/&lt;%= index %&gt;"&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);" data-archive&gt;&lt;%= archiveLink %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="#delete/&lt;%= index %&gt;"&gt;delete&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Notice that there is a CSS class defined called <code>done-yes</code>, which paints the ToDo with a green background. Besides that, there are a bunch of links which we will use to implement the needed functionality. They all have data attributes. The main node of the element, <code>li</code>, has <code>data-index</code>. The value of this attribute is showing the index of the task in the collection. Notice that the special expressions wrapped in <code>&lt;%= ... %&gt;</code> are sent to the <code>template</code> function. That's the data which is injected into the template.</p>

<p>It's time to add some events to the view. </p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// views/list.js
events: {
    'click a[data-up]': 'priorityUp',
    'click a[data-down]': 'priorityDown',
    'click a[data-archive]': 'archive',
    'click input[data-status]': 'changeStatus'
}
</pre>

<p>In Backbone.js the event's definition is a just a hash. You firstly type the name of the event and then a selector. The values of the properties are actually methods of the view.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// views/list.js
priorityUp: function(e) {
    var index = parseInt(e.target.parentNode.parentNode.getAttribute("data-index"));
    this.model.up(index);
},
priorityDown: function(e) {
    var index = parseInt(e.target.parentNode.parentNode.getAttribute("data-index"));
    this.model.down(index);
},
archive: function(e) {
    var index = parseInt(e.target.parentNode.parentNode.getAttribute("data-index"));
    this.model.archive(this.mode !== "archive", index); 
},
changeStatus: function(e) {
    var index = parseInt(e.target.parentNode.parentNode.getAttribute("data-index"));
    this.model.changeStatus(e.target.checked, index);       
}
</pre>

<p>Here we are using <code>e.target</code> coming in to the handler. It points to the DOM element which triggered the event. We are getting the index of the clicked ToDo and updating the model in the collection. With these four functions we finished our class and now the data is shown to the page. </p>

<p>As we mentioned above, we will use the same view for the <code>Archive</code> page.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">list: function(archive) {
    var view = ViewsFactory.list();
    api
    .title(archive ? "Archive:" : "Your ToDos:")
    .changeContent(view.$el);
    view.setMode(archive ? "archive" : null).render();
},
archive: function() {
    this.list(true);
}
</pre>

<p>Above is the same route handler as before, but this time with <code>true</code> as a parameter.</p>

<h2>Adding &amp; Editing ToDos</h2>

<p>Following the primer of the list view, we could create another one which shows a form for adding and editing tasks. Here is how this new class is created:</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// App.js / views factory
form: function() {
    if(!this.formView) {
        this.formView = new api.views.form({
            model: api.todos
        }).on("saved", function() {
            api.router.navigate("", {trigger: true});
        })
    }
    return this.formView;
}
</pre>

<p>Pretty much the same. However, this time we need to do something once the form is submitted. And that's forward the user to the home page. As I said, every object which extends Backbone.js classes, is actually an event dispatcher. There are methods like <code>on</code> and <code>trigger</code> which you can use.</p>

<p>Before we continue with the view code, let's take a look at the HTML template:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;script type="text/template" id="tpl-form"&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;%= title %&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;save&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>We have a <code>textarea</code> and a <code>button</code>. The template expects a <code>title</code> parameter which should be an empty string, if we are adding a new task.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// views/form.js
app.views.form = Backbone.View.extend({
    index: false,
    events: {
        'click button': 'save'
    },
    initialize: function() {
        this.render();
    },
    render: function(index) {
        var template, html = $("#tpl-form").html();
        if(typeof index == 'undefined') {
            this.index = false;
            template = _.template(html, { title: ""});
        } else {
            this.index = parseInt(index);
            this.todoForEditing = this.model.at(this.index);
            template = _.template($("#tpl-form").html(), {
                title: this.todoForEditing.get("title")
            });
        }
        this.$el.html(template);
        this.$el.find("textarea").focus();
        this.delegateEvents();
        return this;
    },
    save: function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        var title = this.$el.find("textarea").val();
        if(title == "") {
            alert("Empty textarea!"); return;
        }
        if(this.index !== false) {
            this.todoForEditing.set("title", title);
        } else {
            this.model.add({ title: title });
        }   
        this.trigger("saved");      
    }
});
</pre>

<p>The view is just 40 lines of code, but it does its job well. There is only one event attached and this is the clicking of the save button. The render method acts differently depending of the passed <code>index</code> parameter. For example, if we are editing a ToDo, we pass the index and fetch the exact model. If not, then the form is empty and a new task will be created. There are several interesting points in the code above. First, in the rendering we used the <code>.focus()</code> method to bring the focus to the form once the view is rendered. Again the <code>delegateEvents</code> function should be called, because the form could be detached and attached again. The <code>save</code> method starts with <code>e.preventDefault()</code>. This removes the default behavior of the button, which in some cases may be submitting the form. And at the end, once everything is done we triggered the <code>saved</code> event notifying the outside world that the ToDo is saved into the collection.</p>

<p>There are two methods for the router which we have to fill in.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">// App.js
newToDo: function() {
    var view = ViewsFactory.form();
    api.title("Create new ToDo:").changeContent(view.$el);
    view.render()
},
editToDo: function(index) {
    var view = ViewsFactory.form();
    api.title("Edit:").changeContent(view.$el);
    view.render(index);
}
</pre>

<p>The difference between them is that we pass in an index, if the <code>edit/:index</code> route is matched. And of course the title of the page is changed accordingly.</p>

<h2>Deleting a Record From the Collection</h2>

<p>For this feature, we don't need a view. The entire job can be done directly in the router's handler.</p>

<pre class="brush: javascript">delteToDo: function(index) {
    api.todos.remove(api.todos.at(parseInt(index)));
    api.router.navigate("", {trigger: true});
}
</pre>

<p>We know the index of the ToDo which we want to delete. There is a <code>remove</code> method in the collection class which accepts a model object. At the end, just forward the user to the home page, which shows the updated list.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Backbone.js has everything you need for building a fully functional, single page application. We could even bind it to a REST back-end service and the framework will synchronize the data between your app and the database. The event driven approach encourages modular programming, along with a good architecture. I'm personally using Backbone.js for several projects and it works very well.</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21417/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21417/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21417/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21417/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-13T19:59:44.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-13T19:59:44.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<h2><span class="sectionnum">1.</span> UIKit Dynamics Essentials</h2>

<p>Before we start writing code, it's necessary to take a look at the essentials of the UIKit Dynamics. UIKit Dynamics is part of the UIKit framework, which means that you don't need to add any additional frameworks to your projects to use it.</p><p>It provides developers with an interface to add realistic effects to the view layer of your applications. It’s important to mention that UIKit Dynamics makes use of a physics engine to do its work. This allows developers to focus on the functionality they'd like to add to their application instead of the implementation. A basic understanding of math and physics is all you need to get started with UIKit Dynamics.</p>

<p>The main component of the UIKit Dynamics interface is the <code class="inline">UIDynamicAnimator</code> class, which is also known as the&nbsp;<b>dynamic animator</b>. This class is responsible for performing the animations using a physics engine under the hood.&nbsp;Even though the dynamic animator is the heart of the&nbsp;UIKit Dynamics interface, it can’t be used on its own.</p><p>In order to work, specific <b>behaviors</b>&nbsp;need to be added to the dynamic animator. These behaviors are&nbsp;a collection of physics forces that define the animation that results from adding one or more behaviors. Programmatically speaking, these dynamic behaviors&nbsp;are classes of the UIKit Dynamics interface and each behavior has specific attributes that can be modified to influence the animation.</p>

<p>The base class of these behaviors is the&nbsp;<code class="inline">UIDynamicBehavior</code> class. Although you're free to create your own custom behaviors,&nbsp;UIKit Dynamics comes with a number of easy-to-use subclasses that mimic common behaviors, such as gravity and collisions.</p>









<ul>
<li><strong><code class="inline">UIGravityBehavior</code></strong>: This <code class="inline">UIDynamicBehavior</code>&nbsp;subclass adds gravity to an item. As a result, the item moves to a certain direction defined by the gravity behavior.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">UICollisionBehavior</code></strong>: This class defines how two items collide with one another or how an item collides with a predefined boundary, visible or invisible.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">UIPushBehavior</code></strong>: As its name indicates, this behavior gives an item a push, it accelerates the item. The push can be <b>continuous</b> or&nbsp;<b>instantaneous</b>. A continuous push behavior gradually applies the force of the push while an instantaneous push behavior applies the force the moment the behavior is added.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">UISnapBehavior</code></strong>: A snap behavior defines how an item snaps to another item or a point in space. The snap behavior is customizable in several ways. For example, the item can either snap to a point without any bounciness or jiggle for a few moments before coming to a halt.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">UIAttachmentBehavior</code></strong>: An attachment behavior defines how two dynamic items are connected to one another or how a dynamic item is connected to an anchor point.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the most important dynamic behaviors currently provided by the UIKit Dynamics interface. In order for these behaviors to do their work, they need to be initialized, configured, and added to a <b>dynamic animator</b> object, which we covered earlier.</p><p>Combining behaviors is possible as long as they don’t cause any conflicts. Also note that some behaviors can only be added once to the dynamic animator object. For example, adding two instances of the <code class="inline">UIGravityBehavior</code> class to the dynamic animator will result in an exception.</p><p>The behaviors are always applied to dynamic items. A dynamic item is any object that conforms to the <code class="inline">UIDynamicItem</code> protocol. The great thing is that <code class="inline">UIView</code> and <code class="inline">UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes</code> classes already conform to this protocol. This means that every view in your application can leverage&nbsp;UIKit Dynamics.</p>

<p>There's one more <code class="inline">UIDynamicBehavior</code> subclass that's worth mentioning, <code class="inline">UIDynamicItemBehavior</code>.&nbsp;Instead of defining a specific behavior, it offers a base dynamic animation configuration that can be applied to dynamic items. It has a number of properties to define the behavior:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><code class="inline">elasticity</code></strong>: This property defines the elasticity of a collision between dynamic items or a dynamic item and a boundary. The value ranges from <code class="inline">0.0</code> to <code class="inline">1.0</code>&nbsp;with the latter being a very elastic collision.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">density</code></strong>: This property defines the mass of a dynamic item with a high value resulting in a heavy object. This can be useful if you don’t want a dynamic item to be moved when another item collides with it.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">resistance</code></strong>: The property’s name speaks for itself. The property defines the velocity damping of a dynamic item.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">angularResistance</code></strong>: This one is similar to the <code class="inline">resistance</code> property, but the&nbsp;<code class="inline">angularResistance</code>&nbsp;property defines angular velocity damping.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">friction</code></strong>: This property defines the friction or resistance of two dynamic items that slide against each other.</li>
<li><strong><code class="inline">allowsRotation</code></strong>: This one simply specifies if a dynamic item is allowed to rotate or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>Combining dynamic behaviors can give spectacular results. In this tutorial, we'll use most of the behaviors listed above.</p>

<p>I encourage you to visit Apple’s official documentation and read more about the key classes of UIKit Dynamics. Also, after finishing this tutorial, it’s useful to play around with the result to get a better understanding of the concepts and the various behaviors defined by UIKit Dynamics.</p>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">2.</span> Application Overview</h2>

<p>I've already mentioned in the introduction that we're going to create two reusable components that will leverage UIKit Dynamics. In this tutorial, we'll create a custom animated menu. Take a look at the final result below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/205/posts/20942/image/t10_8_menu_ready.gif"></figure>

<p>This component is a <code class="inline">UIView</code> object that slides in and out of the screen. To make the menu appear and disappear, a simple&nbsp;swipe gesture is used. The items of the menu are listed in a plain table view. The animation you see in the above screenshot is achieved by combining a number of dynamic behaviors.</p>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">3.</span> Creating the Project</h2>

<p>Start by launching Xcode and create a new project. Select the <strong>Single View Application</strong>&nbsp;template in the <strong>Application</strong> category of the <strong>iOS</strong> section. Click&nbsp;<b>Next</b> to continue.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/205/posts/20942/image/t10_1_template1.png"></figure>

<p>Name the project <strong>DynamicsDemo</strong>&nbsp;and make&nbsp;sure that&nbsp;<strong>Devices</strong> is set to&nbsp;<strong>iPhone</strong>.

<h2><span class="sectionnum">4.</span> Understanding the Menu</h2>

<p>Before we begin implementing the menu component, it’s important to take a closer look at how it should operate. As I've already mentioned, the menu should show itself by sliding into view from the right to the left and hide itself by sliding out of view from left to right.</p><p>Showing and hiding the menu is triggered by a swipe gesture. UIKit Dynamics will be responsible for the behavior or animation of the menu. The behaviors we'll use are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Gravity behavior</strong>: The gravity behavior will make the menu move in the right direction, left or right. Without the gravity behavior, the menu won't do much.</li>
<li><strong>Collision behavior</strong>: The collision behavior is equally important. Without it, the menu wouldn't stop moving once gravity was applied to it. An invisible boundary will trigger a collision and make the menu stop where we want it to stop.</li>
<li><strong>Push behavior</strong>: Even though the gravity and collision behaviors can animate the menu in and out, we will give it an extra push&nbsp;or acceleration using a push behavior. This will make the animation snappier.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic item behavior</strong>: We will also add a dynamic item behavior for defining the elasticity of the menu. This&nbsp;will result in a bouncy collision.</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead of instantiating the above behaviors every time they need to take effect, we will initialize them once. We apply and configure the behaviors when we need them, which will depend on the position of the menu and the direction it needs to move in.</p>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">5.</span> Properties, Structures, and Initialization</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Creating the Class</h3>

<p>Let’s begin by adding a new class to the project. Press <b>Command-N</b>, select&nbsp;<strong>Objective-C class</strong>&nbsp;from the list of templates in the <b>iOS &gt;&nbsp;Cocoa Touch</b> section. Click <b>Next</b>&nbsp;to continue.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/205/posts/20942/image/t10_3_add_class1.png"></figure>

<p>Name the new class&nbsp;<code class="inline">MenuComponent</code>&nbsp;and make sure the class inherits from <b></b><code class="inline">NSObject</code>. Click <b>Next</b>, tell Xcode where you want to save the class files, and hit <b>Create</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/205/posts/20942/image/t10_4_add_class2.png"></figure>

<h3>Step 2: Declaring Properties</h3>

<p>Open<b>&nbsp;MenuComponent.h</b>&nbsp;and define an enumeration that will represent the menu direction. The direction can be left-to-right or right-to-left. Add the following code snippet below the import statement.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">typedef enum MenuDirectionOptionTypes{
    menuDirectionLeftToRight,
    menuDirectionRightToLeft
} MenuDirectionOptions;
</pre>

<p>Open <b>MenuComponent.m</b>, add a class extension, and declare the following properties:</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface MenuComponent()

@property (nonatomic, strong) UIView *menuView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIView *backgroundView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIView *targetView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UITableView *optionsTableView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *menuOptions;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *menuOptionImages;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIDynamicAnimator *animator;
@property (nonatomic) MenuDirectionOptions menuDirection;
@property (nonatomic) CGRect menuFrame;
@property (nonatomic) CGRect menuInitialFrame;
@property (nonatomic) BOOL isMenuShown;

@end</pre>

<ul><li><code>menuView</code>: This is the view object of the menu that will be animated in and out of view. The table view will be a subview of this view.</li>
<li><code>backgroundView</code>: The background view is a semi-transparent view that will prevent the user from tapping anything but the menu view.</li>
<li><code>targetView</code>: This is the superview to which the menu and background views will be added.</li>
<li><code>optionsTableView</code>: This is the table view that will list the menu options.</li>
<li><code>menuOptions</code>: This array will contain the menu options that the table view will display.</li>
<li><code>menuOptionImages</code>: This array will contain the file names of the images that on the left of each table view cell.</li>
<li><code>animator</code>: This is the <code class="inline">UIDynamicAnimator</code> instance that will animate the menu.</li>
<li><code>menuDirection</code>: This property is of type <code class="inline">MenuDirectionOptions</code>&nbsp;and determines the direction in which the menu will move.</li>
<li><code>menuFrame</code>: This is the frame of the menu.</li>
<li><code>menuInitialFrame</code>: And this is the initial frame of the menu.</li>
<li><code>isMenuShown</code>: A flag that indicates whether the menu is shown or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these private properties, we also need to declare some public properties. Revisit&nbsp;<b>MenuComponent.h</b>&nbsp;and add the following code snippet:</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface MenuComponent : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *menuBackgroundColor;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSMutableDictionary *tableSettings;
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat optionCellHeight;
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat acceleration;

@end</pre>

<ul>
<li><code>menuBackgroundColor</code>: This property is used to set the menu’s background color.</li>
<li><code>tableSettings</code>: This is the dictionary I mentioned in the previous section. It will let us configure the table view by setting a number of options.</li>
<li><code>optionCellHeight</code>: This is the only table view attribute that cannot be set using the <code class="inline">tableSettings</code> dictionary. It specifies the row height of the table view's cells.</li>
<li><code>acceleration</code>: This property specifies the magnitude of the push behavior, in other words, the amount of force applied to the menu view when it's swiped into and out of view.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Implementing the Initialization Method</h3>

<p>In this step, we declare a custom initializer in which we set:</p>

<ul>
<li>the final frame of the menu view, that is, the frame when the animation is completed and the menu is visible</li>
<li>the target view to which the menu view will be added as a subview</li><li>the array of options and images displayed by the table view</li>
<li>the direction of the animation when the menu is shown</li>
</ul>

<p>The interface of the custom initializer is shown below. Add it to the public interface of the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> class.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (id)initMenuWithFrame:(CGRect)frame targetView:(UIView *)targetView direction:(MenuDirectionOptions)direction options:(NSArray *)options optionImages:(NSArray *)optionImages;</pre>

<p>Let's take a look at the implementation of the custom initializer. Add the following code snippet to the implementation file of the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> class. The implementation is pretty straightforward as you can see below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (id)initMenuWithFrame:(CGRect)frame targetView:(UIView *)targetView direction:(MenuDirectionOptions)direction options:(NSArray *)options optionImages:(NSArray *)optionImages {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        self.menuFrame = frame;
        self.targetView = targetView;
        self.menuDirection = direction;
        self.menuOptions = options;
        self.menuOptionImages = optionImages;
    }
    
    return self;
}</pre>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">6.</span> Setting Everything Up</h2><p>There are a number of properties that need to be initialized and I think it's therefore a good idea to group them together in a few private methods. Navigate to the class extension of the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> class and declare the following method:</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface MenuComponent()

...

- (void)setupMenuView;
- (void)setupBackgroundView;
- (void)setupOptionsTableView;
- (void)setInitialTableViewSettings;
- (void)setupSwipeGestureRecognizer;

@end</pre>

<h3><code class="inline">setupMenuView</code></h3><p>In&nbsp;<code>setupMenuView</code>, we set up the menu view. Because the menu initially needs to be out of the screen’s visible area, we start by calculating&nbsp;the menu's initial frame. We then initialize the menu view with its initial frame, set its background color, and add it as a subview to the target or parent view.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)setupMenuView {
    if (self.menuDirection == menuDirectionLeftToRight) {
        self.menuInitialFrame = CGRectMake(-self.menuFrame.size.width,
                                           self.menuFrame.origin.y,
                                           self.menuFrame.size.width,
                                           self.menuFrame.size.height);
    }
    else{
        self.menuInitialFrame = CGRectMake(self.targetView.frame.size.width,
                                           self.menuFrame.origin.y,
                                           self.menuFrame.size.width,
                                           self.menuFrame.size.height);
    }
    
    self.menuView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.menuInitialFrame];
    [self.menuView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:0.0 green:0.47 blue:0.39 alpha:1.0]];
    [self.targetView addSubview:self.menuView];
}
</pre>

<h3><code class="inline">setupBackgroundView</code></h3><p>In&nbsp;<code>setupBackgroundView</code>, we set up the background view. Note that the <code class="inline">alpha</code> value of the background view is initially set to <code class="inline">0.0</code>. We update this value the moment the menu appears.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)setupBackgroundView {
    self.backgroundView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.targetView.frame];
    [self.backgroundView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor grayColor]];
    [self.backgroundView setAlpha:0.0];
    [self.targetView addSubview:self.backgroundView];
}
</pre>

<h3><code class="inline">setupOptionsTableView</code></h3><p>In&nbsp;<code>setupOptionsTableView</code>, we start by initializing the table by invoking <code>initWithFrame:</code>&nbsp;in which the menu view’s size is used for the table view's size. The&nbsp;<code class="inline">MenuComponent</code>&nbsp;instance is set as the table view's data source and delegate.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)setupOptionsTableView {
    self.optionsTableView = [[UITableView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.size.height) style:UITableViewStylePlain];
    [self.optionsTableView setBackgroundColor:[UIColor clearColor]];
    [self.optionsTableView setScrollEnabled:NO];
    [self.optionsTableView setSeparatorStyle:UITableViewCellSeparatorStyleNone];
    [self.menuView addSubview:self.optionsTableView];
    
    [self.optionsTableView setDelegate:self];
    [self.optionsTableView setDataSource:self];
}</pre>

<p>By setting the the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> instance as the table view's data source and delegate, the compiler tells us that the MenuComponent class doesn't conform to the <code class="inline">UITableViewDataSource</code> and <code class="inline">UITableViewDelegate</code> protocols. Let's fix this by updating the header file of the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> class as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface MenuComponent : NSObject &lt;UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate&gt;</pre>

<h3><code class="inline">setupInitialTableViewSettings</code></h3><p>In&nbsp;<code>setupInitialTableViewSettings</code>, we initialize and populate the <code>tableSettings</code>&nbsp;dictionary that we declared earlier in the class's public interface.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)setInitialTableViewSettings {
    self.tableSettings = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:
                          [UIFont fontWithName:@"American Typewriter" size:15.0], @"font",
                          [NSNumber numberWithInt:NSTextAlignmentLeft], @"textAlignment",
                          [UIColor whiteColor], @"textColor",
                          [NSNumber numberWithInt:UITableViewCellSelectionStyleGray], @"selectionStyle",
                          nil];
}</pre>

<h3><code class="inline">setupSwipGestureRecognizer</code></h3><p>In&nbsp;<code>setupSwipeGestureRecognizer</code>, we initialize and configure the swipe gesture recognizer that's used to hide the menu view.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)setupSwipeGestureRecognizer {
    UISwipeGestureRecognizer *hideMenuGesture = [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(hideMenuWithGesture:)];
    if (self.menuDirection == menuDirectionLeftToRight) {
        hideMenuGesture.direction = UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionLeft;
    }
    else{
        hideMenuGesture.direction = UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionRight;
    }
    [self.menuView addGestureRecognizer:hideMenuGesture];
}
</pre>

<p>Two things are worth pointing out. First, the direction of the swipe gesture depends on the value of the&nbsp;<code class="inline">menuDirection</code>&nbsp;property. Second, the <code>hideMenuWithGesture:</code> method is a private method that is invoked every time the gesture recognizer detects a swipe gesture. We'll implement this method later, but, to get rid of the compiler warning, declare the method in the private class extension of the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> class as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface MenuComponent()

...

- (void)hideMenuWithGesture:(UISwipeGestureRecognizer *)gesture;

@end
</pre>

<p>Let's take advantage of the work we just did by invoking the helper methods in the initialization method as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (id)initMenuWithFrame:(CGRect)frame targetView:(UIView *)targetView direction:(MenuDirectionOptions)direction options:(NSArray *)options optionImages:(NSArray *)optionImages {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        ...
        
        // Setup the background view.
        [self setupBackgroundView];
        
        // Setup the menu view.
        [self setupMenuView];
        
        // Setup the options table view.
        [self setupOptionsTableView];
        
        // Set the initial table view settings.
        [self setInitialTableViewSettings];
        
        // Setup the swipe gesture recognizer.
        [self setupSwipeGestureRecognizer];
    }
    
    return self;
}</pre>

<p>Note that the background view is set up before menu view is to make sure the background view is positioned below the menu view.</p><p>Finally, initialize the remaining properties after invoking the helper methods as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (id)initMenuWithFrame:(CGRect)frame targetView:(UIView *)targetView direction:(MenuDirectionOptions)direction options:(NSArray *)options optionImages:(NSArray *)optionImages {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        ...
        
        // Initialize the animator.
        self.animator = [[UIDynamicAnimator alloc] initWithReferenceView:self.targetView];
        
        // Set the initial height for each cell row.
        self.optionCellHeight = 50.0;
        
        // Set the initial acceleration value (push magnitude).
        self.acceleration = 15.0;
        
        // Indicate that initially the menu is not shown.
        self.isMenuShown = NO;
    }
    
    return self;
}</pre>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">7.</span> Dynamic Behaviors</h2>

<p>Every time the menu view appears or disappears, we use the same dynamic behaviors. We will therefore reuse those dynamic behaviors. The only thing that differs is the direction &nbsp;of the menu during the animation.</p><p>We're going to create one method in which we'll initialize and apply the necessary dynamic behaviors and we’ll call this method every time the menu state needs to change. Start by updating the class's private class extension with the <code class="inline">toggleMenu</code> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface MenuComponent()

...

- (void)toggleMenu;

@end
</pre>

<p>I already mentioned that the dynamic behaviors that will be used to animate the menu are gravity, collision, and push. Each of these behaviors has one or more properties that, when modified, determine the direction of the animation.</p>

<ul>
<li>The gravity behavior has a <code>direction</code> property, a&nbsp;<code>CGVector</code>&nbsp;structure that specifies the direction of the gravity. For example, by setting the <code class="inline">direction</code> property to <code class="inline">{ 1.0, 0.0 }</code> the gravity behavior pulls to the right whereas a value of <code class="inline">{ 0.0, 1.0 }</code>&nbsp;results in a force that pulls towards the bottom.</li>
<li>The collision behavior works either between two dynamic items or between a dynamic item and a boundary. In our example, we need an invisible boundary defined by two points&nbsp;that stops the&nbsp;menu view.</li>
<li>The push behavior has a <code class="inline">magnitude</code> property defining the acceleration applied to a dynamic item. The value also determines the direction of the push.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the <code>toggleMenu</code> method, we first calculate the values of the aforementioned properties. We then create and configure the dynamic behaviors, and add them to the dynamic animator object.</p><p>It’s important to emphasize that the values of&nbsp;<code>isMenuShown</code>, indicating whether the menu is currently shown or not, and <code>menuDirection</code>, specifying the direction of the animation, determine the values of the aforementioned properties.</p>

<p>The <code>animator</code> object has an array that contains every dynamic behavior that has been added to it. Every time the <code>toggleMenu</code> method is called, the existing dynamic behaviors need to be removed by clearing the array, because some dynamic behaviors cannot be added twice to the dynamic behavior, such as the gravity behavior.</p>

<p>Let's start implementing the <code class="inline">toggleMenu</code> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)toggleMenu{
    // Remove any previous behaviors added to the animator.
    [self.animator removeAllBehaviors];
    
    // The following variables will define the direction of the menu view animation.
    
    // This variable indicates the gravity direction.
    CGFloat gravityDirectionX;
    
    // These two points specify an invisible boundary where the menu view should collide.
    // The boundary must be always to the side of the gravity direction so as the menu view
    // can stop moving.
    CGPoint collisionPointFrom, collisionPointTo;
    
    // The higher the push magnitude value, the greater the acceleration of the menu view.
    // If that value is set to 0.0, then only the gravity force will be applied to the
    // menu view.
    CGFloat pushMagnitude = self.acceleration;
}</pre>

<p>The <code>gravityDirectionX</code>, <code>collisionPointFrom</code>, <code>collisionPointTo</code>, and <code>pushMagnitude</code> variables will hold the values that we'll assign to the dynamic behaviors later. Let’s set their values, depending on the menu's state and the animation direction.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)toggleMenu{
    ...
    
    // Check if the menu is shown or not.
    if (!self.isMenuShown) {
        // If the menu view is hidden and it's about to be shown, then specify each variable
        // value depending on the animation direction.
        if (self.menuDirection == menuDirectionLeftToRight) {
            // The value 1.0 means that gravity "moves" the view towards the right side.
            gravityDirectionX = 1.0;
            
            // The From and To points define an invisible boundary, where the X-origin point
            // equals to the desired X-origin point that the menu view should collide, and the
            // Y-origin points specify the highest and lowest point of the boundary.
            
            // If the menu view is being shown from left to right, then the collision boundary
            // should be defined so as to be at the right of the initial menu view position.
            collisionPointFrom = CGPointMake(self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.origin.y);
            collisionPointTo = CGPointMake(self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.size.height);
        }
        else{
            // The value -1.0 means that gravity "pulls" the view towards the left side.
            gravityDirectionX = -1.0;
            
            // If the menu view is being shown from right to left, then the collision boundary
            // should be defined so as to be at the left of the initial menu view position.
            collisionPointFrom = CGPointMake(self.targetView.frame.size.width - self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.origin.y);
            collisionPointTo = CGPointMake(self.targetView.frame.size.width - self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.size.height);
            
            // Set to the pushMagnitude variable the opposite value.
            pushMagnitude = (-1) * pushMagnitude;
        }
        
        // Make the background view semi-transparent.
        [self.backgroundView setAlpha:0.25];
    }
    else{
        // In case the menu is about to be hidden, then the exact opposite values should be
        // set to all variables for succeeding the opposite animation.
        
        if (self.menuDirection == menuDirectionLeftToRight) {
            gravityDirectionX = -1.0;
            collisionPointFrom = CGPointMake(-self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.origin.y);
            collisionPointTo = CGPointMake(-self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.size.height);
            
            // Set to the pushMagnitude variable the opposite value.
            pushMagnitude = (-1) * pushMagnitude;
        }
        else{
            gravityDirectionX = 1.0;
            collisionPointFrom = CGPointMake(self.targetView.frame.size.width + self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.origin.y);
            collisionPointTo = CGPointMake(self.targetView.frame.size.width + self.menuFrame.size.width, self.menuFrame.size.height);
        }
        
        // Make the background view fully transparent.
        [self.backgroundView setAlpha:0.0];
    }
}</pre>

<p>The above code snippet is pretty simple to understand, despite its size.&nbsp;The comments in the code will help you understand what's going on. Note that the&nbsp;background view’s&nbsp;<code class="inline">alpha</code>&nbsp;value is determined by whether the menu is about to be shown or hidden.</p>

<p>It's time to add the dynamic behaviors. Let’s start with the gravity behavior.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">UIGravityBehavior *gravityBehavior = [[UIGravityBehavior alloc] initWithItems:@[self.menuView]];
[gravityBehavior setGravityDirection:CGVectorMake(gravityDirectionX, 0.0)];
[self.animator addBehavior:gravityBehavior];</pre>

<p>We use the <code>gravityDirectionX</code> variable to set the gravity's <code class="inline">gravityDirection</code> property.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">UICollisionBehavior *collisionBehavior = [[UICollisionBehavior alloc] initWithItems:@[self.menuView]];
[collisionBehavior addBoundaryWithIdentifier:@"collisionBoundary"
                                       fromPoint:collisionPointFrom
                                         toPoint:collisionPointTo];
[self.animator addBehavior:collisionBehavior];</pre>

<p>You may have noticed that the initialization methods of the gravity and collision behaviors accept an array that contains the dynamic items to which the behavior will be applied. In our example, there is only the menu view.</p>

<p>Before we add the push behavior to the dynamic animator, let’s first create a <b>dynamic item behavior</b>, which is, simply put, a general purpose behavior that we'll use for setting the<b> elasticity</b> of the collision. The greater the <code class="inline">elasticity</code> value, the greater the bounciness of the collision between the view and the invisible boundary. The accepted values range from <code class="inline">0.0</code> to <code class="inline">1.0</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">UIDynamicItemBehavior *itemBehavior = [[UIDynamicItemBehavior alloc] initWithItems:@[self.menuView]];
[itemBehavior setElasticity:0.35];
[self.animator addBehavior:itemBehavior];</pre>

<p>We could have set more behavior attributes using the <code>itemBehavior</code> object, such as the <b>resistance</b> or the <b>friction</b>. You can play around with these properties later if you want.</p><p>Let's now add the push behavior that will accelerate the menu.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">UIPushBehavior *pushBehavior = [[UIPushBehavior alloc] initWithItems:@[self.menuView] mode:UIPushBehaviorModeInstantaneous];
[pushBehavior setMagnitude:pushMagnitude];
[self.animator addBehavior:pushBehavior];</pre>

<p>By setting <code class="inline">mode</code> to&nbsp;<code class="inline">UIPushBehaviorModeInstantaneous</code>&nbsp;the force of the push behavior is applied all at once instead of gradually. The dynamic behaviors have now been added to the dynamic animator, which means it's time to make the menu view appear and disappear.</p>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">8.</span> Showing and Hiding the Menu</h2>

<h3>Step 1: <code class="inline">showMenu</code></h3>

<p>To show and hide the menu, we need to invoke the private&nbsp;<code>toggleMenu</code> method. The menu &nbsp;should appear when a swipe gesture is detected by the target view in the direction of the swipe. Let's start by declaring a public method that we can invoke to show the menu. Open&nbsp;<b>ViewController.h</b>&nbsp;and declare the <code class="inline">showMenu</code> method as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface MenuComponent : NSObject &lt;UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate&gt;

...

- (void)showMenu;

@end</pre>

<p>The implementation is very simple, because all we do is invoke the <code class="inline">toggleMenu</code> method. Note that we update <code class="inline">isMenuShown</code> to reflect the new state of the menu.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)showMenu {
    if (!self.isMenuShown) {
        [self toggleMenu];
        
        self.isMenuShown = YES;
    }
}</pre>

<h3>Step 2: Showing the Menu</h3>

<p>Let's start using the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> class in our view controller. Open <b>ViewController.m</b>&nbsp;and add an import statement at the top.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">#import "MenuComponent.h"</pre>

<p>In the <code class="inline">ViewController</code>'s private class extension, declare a <code>menuComponent</code> property of type <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code>&nbsp;for the menu.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface ViewController ()

@property (nonatomic, strong) MenuComponent *menuComponent;

@end</pre>

<p>Before we initialize the menu, let's create the gesture recognizer that will detect the swipe gestures to show and hide the menu. We do this in the view controller's <code class="inline">viewDidLoad</code> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    UISwipeGestureRecognizer *showMenuGesture = [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(showMenu:)];
    
    showMenuGesture.direction = UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionLeft;
    
    [self.view addGestureRecognizer:showMenuGesture];
}</pre>

<p>The <code>showMenu:</code> method triggered by the gesture recognizer is a private helper method that we'll implement shortly. Note that the gesture direction is set to&nbsp;<code>UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionLeft</code>, which means that we want the menu to animate in from the right to the left.</p>

<p>With the gesture recognizer initialized, it's time to create the menu using the initializer we implemented earlier in the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> class. Add the following code snippet to the view controller's <code class="inline">viewDidLoad</code> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">    CGRect desiredMenuFrame = CGRectMake(0.0, 20.0, 150.0, self.view.frame.size.height);
    self.menuComponent = [[MenuComponent alloc] initMenuWithFrame:desiredMenuFrame
                                                       targetView:self.view
                                                        direction:menuDirectionRightToLeft
                                                          options:@[@"Download", @"Upload", @"E-mail", @"Settings", @"About"]
                                                     optionImages:@[@"download", @"upload", @"email", @"settings", @"info"]];</pre>

<p>Make sure that the direction you pass in the initialization method matches that of the gesture recognizer.</p>

<p>Next, declare the <code>showMenu:</code>&nbsp;method in the view controller's class extension.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface ViewController ()

@property (nonatomic, strong) MenuComponent *menuComponent;

- (void)showMenu:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer;

@end</pre>

<p>The implementation of the <code class="inline">showMenu:</code> method couldn't be easier.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)showMenu:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer{
    [self.menuComponent showMenu];
}</pre>

<p>Before running the app for the first time, revisit&nbsp;<b>MenuComponent.m</b>&nbsp;and comment out the invocation of the&nbsp;<code class="inline">setupOptionsTableView</code>&nbsp;method in the initialization method. This is necessary if we want to prevent our application from crashing, because we haven't implemented the table view protocols yet.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">// Setup the options table view.
// [self setupOptionsTableView];</pre>

<p>Run the application and swipe from the right to the left. At this point, the menu should appear, but we can't make it disappear and the menu doesn't display any options yet.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/205/posts/20942/image/t10_5_menu_appearing.gif"></figure>

<h3>Step 3: Hiding the Menu</h3>

<p>Even though the swipe gesture for showing the menu is performed on the view to which the menu is added, the gesture for hiding the menu needs to be detected by the menu itself. Do you remember that we created a gesture recognizer in the <code class="inline">MenuComponent</code> class and declared&nbsp;<code>hideMenuWithGesture:</code>? The latter method will be invoked when the menu needs to be hidden.</p>

<p>Let’s implement&nbsp;<code class="inline">hideMenuWithGesture:</code> in&nbsp;<b>MenuComponent.m</b>. Its implementation is pretty simple as you can see below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)hideMenuWithGesture:(UISwipeGestureRecognizer *)gesture {
    // Make a call to toggleMenu method for hiding the menu.
    [self toggleMenu];
    
    // Indicate that the menu is not shown.
    self.isMenuShown = NO;
}</pre>

<p>If you run the application now, you should be able to show and hide the menu with a swipe gesture.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/205/posts/20942/image/t10_6_menu_show_hide.gif"></figure>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">9.</span> Menu Options</h2>

<p>The menu view is now capable of appearing and disappearing. It's time to focus our attention on setting up the options table view and displaying the menu options. We've already declared a few options during the menu's initialization in the view controller's <code class="inline">viewDidLoad</code> method. Let's see what we need to do to display them.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is implement the required method of the <code class="inline">UITableViewDataSource</code> and&nbsp;<code class="inline">UITableViewDelegate</code>&nbsp;protocols. Note that the cell height is specified by the&nbsp;<code>optionCellHeight</code> property.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView {
    return 1;
}


- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    return [self.menuOptions count];
}


- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    return self.optionCellHeight;
}</pre>

<p>In <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code>, we configure the cells to display the menu options and images. Note that we use the <code class="inline">tableSettings</code> object to configure the table view cells.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@"optionCell"];
    
    if (cell == nil) {
        cell = [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifier:@"optionCell"];
    }
    
    // Set the selection style.
    [cell setSelectionStyle:[[self.tableSettings objectForKey:@"selectionStyle"] intValue]];
    
    // Set the cell's text and specify various properties of it.
    cell.textLabel.text = [self.menuOptions objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
    [cell.textLabel setFont:[self.tableSettings objectForKey:@"font"]];
    [cell.textLabel setTextAlignment:[[self.tableSettings objectForKey:@"textAlignment"] intValue]];
    [cell.textLabel setTextColor:[self.tableSettings objectForKey:@"textColor"]];
    
    // If the menu option images array is not nil, then set the cell image.
    if (self.menuOptionImages != nil) {
        [cell.imageView setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:[self.menuOptionImages objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]]];
        [cell.imageView setTintColor:[UIColor whiteColor]];
    }
    
    
    [cell setBackgroundColor:[UIColor clearColor]];
    
    return cell;
}</pre>

<p>Before running the application, make sure to uncomment the call to <code class="inline">setupOptionsTableView</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">// Setup the options table view.
[self setupOptionsTableView];
</pre>

<p>That’s it. Run the application and swipe from right to left to show the menu and its options.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/205/posts/20942/image/t10_7_menu_options.gif"></figure>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">10.</span> Handling User Selection</h2>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, we won't be implementing a delegate protocol for the options menu. Instead, we'll make use of blocks. We won't be adding any new methods though. Instead, we're going to slightly modify the <code>showMenu</code>&nbsp;method. Start by updating its declaration in <b>MenuComponent.h</b> as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)showMenuWithSelectionHandler:(void(^)(NSInteger selectedOptionIndex))handler;</pre>

<p>The <code class="inline">showMenu:</code>&nbsp;method now accepts one argument, a block. The block also accepts one argument, the user's selection.</p><p>This also means that we need to store the block, because we need to invoke it when the user selects an option from the menu. In <b>MenuComponent.m</b>,&nbsp;declare a private property for storing the block.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">@interface MenuComponent()
...

@property (nonatomic, strong) void(^selectionHandler)(NSInteger);

@end</pre>

<p>We then need to update the <code class="inline">showMenu:</code>&nbsp;method as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)showMenuWithSelectionHandler:(void (^)(NSInteger))handler {
    if (!self.isMenuShown) {
        self.selectionHandler = handler;
        
        [self toggleMenu];
        
        self.isMenuShown = YES;
    }
}</pre>

<p>We start by storing<code class="inline">handler</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code class="inline">selectionHandler</code>&nbsp;property.&nbsp;Whenever the user selects an item from the table view, we invoke the selection handler. Take a look at the implementation of <code>tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:</code>&nbsp;for clarification.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    [[tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath] setSelected:NO];
    
    if (self.selectionHandler) {
        self.selectionHandler(indexPath.row);
    }
}</pre>

<p>Finally, we need to update the view controller to use the new <code class="inline">showMenu:</code> method. Update the view controller's <code class="inline">showMenu:</code> method, which is invoked when a swipe gesture is detected, with the one shown below. To make sure that everything is working, we show an alert view displaying the user's selection.</p>

<pre class="brush: objc">- (void)showMenu:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer {
    [self.menuComponent showMenuWithSelectionHandler:^(NSInteger selectedOptionIndex) {
        UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"UIKit Dynamics Menu"
                                                        message:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"You selected option #%d", selectedOptionIndex + 1]
                                                       delegate:nil
                                              cancelButtonTitle:nil
                                              otherButtonTitles:@"Okay", nil];
        [alert show];
    }];
}</pre>

<p>Run the application once again to make sure everything works as expected. The menu component class is ready.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/205/posts/20942/image/t10_8_menu_ready.gif"></figure>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

And in a content management system like WordPress, you need to be careful about your HTML &amp; CSS both in your theme and your content. In this tutorial, we're going to talk about validating a WordPress website.</p>

<h2>Why Validate a Website?</h2>

<p>Or, perhaps the better question is what is the meaning of validation?</p>

<p>Simply put, validation of a web page means making the page's code compliant with the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standards. This is usually done by checking the HTML &amp; CSS output of your web pages with a validation tool. Just like there are grammar rules in different languages, there are rules in computer programming, too. Validation checks your web page to see if the page follows those rules.</p>

<p>In addition to that, we also need to keep our theme's code compliant with <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards">WordPress Coding Standards</a>. This could be done manually (by having common sense while coding a WordPress theme) or using tools like the famous <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/" rel="external" target="_blank">Theme Check</a> plugin.</p>

<p>And why do we need to validate, you ask? There's more than one answer. Let's have a look:</p>

<h3>Validation Allows You to Debug Your Pages</h3>

<p>When I first started to toy around with HTML in 2005, I coded those awful web pages, full of errors like improper nesting of elements or forgetting to close the tags I opened. CSS was even worse: Just a simple semicolon error or an undetectable typo meant that I needed more and more time for my experiments and projects.</p>

<p>But even after nine years of hard work, I can make mistakes despite the fact that I'm <i>almost</i>&nbsp;an expert in HTML and CSS. Luckily, tools like W3C's HTML validator can help us debug almost every error there is in your HTML code. Whether it be by pasting the code directly, uploading the HTML file or submitting the URI of the web page, you can see what did you do wrong in your code, where the problem is, and suggestions on how to fix it. Fixing those errors might even prevent greater problems.</p>

<h3>Validation Results in Better SEO</h3>

<p>Never forget this fact: Search engine spiders <i>love</i> semantic web pages<strong>.</strong> It helps those crawlers understand pages better and in SERP listings, you naturally gain advantage against the pages which don't validate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it shows that you <em>care</em> about your website. Validating your web page means that you made an effort to have a structural, semantic web page (or you already have the tools or the knowledge to create that page). That's a huge plus for search engines and that "huge plus" may bump your rankings up.</p>

<h3>Validation Makes Your Website More Accessible &amp; Compatible</h3>

<p>Have you ever thought about how a browser <em>reads</em> a web page? They have "engines" to parse the code and convert it into a visual experience for human beings. Unfortunately, different web browsers have different engines and that can result in handling of your pages differently.</p>

<p>In a valid web page, most differences are really tiny and acceptable for almost everyone, but an invalid web page might be read so differently that people might not even be able to see your pages properly in their iPhones, Kindles or whatever browser they may be using. Validation fixes almost every major difference and make your web page readable by nearly all web browsers.</p>

<h2>Validation Tools for Your WordPress Website</h2>

<p>Now we know <em>why</em> we should validate our web pages, let's see <em>how</em> to do it. In order to skip the double-talk, I'm not going to mention that you need to validate your post contents; but keep in mind that most of the things I'll say also goes for the content you write in WordPress posts and pages.</p>

<h3>Validating HTML Code</h3>

<p><a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C's HTML Markup Validation Service</a> is probably the easiest and the most popular tool available to check and validate your web page. Using this tool, you can spot almost every validation error ranging from missing ALT attributes for your IMG tags to placing a block-level element inside an inline element.</p>

<p>You can grade your HTML code by giving the address of your web page, uploading the HTML file or pasting the HTML code directly.</p>

<h3>Validating CSS Styles</h3>

<p>Just like the HTML validation tool, <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C's CSS Validation Service</a> is the most popular CSS validation tool in the web. And like the HTML validator, you can validate your CSS by pasting the URI, uploading a CSS file or pasting your code directly.</p>

<p>Note that this tool will detect "CSS hacks" as errors and in order to stay valid, you need to find another way to support older browsers.</p>

<h3>Validating WordPress Feeds</h3>

<p>Although it's not very popular, "feed validation" is one of the another important aspect of validation of your website. And you can check your WordPress feed against errors with <a href="http://validator.w3.org/feed/">W3C's Feed Validation Service for Atom and RSS</a>. Luckily (and naturally) the default feeds of WordPress validates perfectly, so your feeds are probably already valid if you're not using a plugin to tamper with feeds.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's a noteworthy tool called <a href="http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/">Unicorn by W3C</a>, which is basically a unified validator. Although <a href="http://code.w3.org/unicorn/timeline">it looks like a discontinued open-source application</a>, it still gives satisfying results about HTML, CSS, feed and i18n validation. The results page is a bit confusing but if you ever need to get results of multiple validation tests, you'll love this tool.</p>

<h3>Validating Your WordPress Theme with Theme Check</h3>

<p>Along with W3C's standards, WordPress has its standards, too:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/">PHP Coding Standards</a>&nbsp;includes using single &amp; double quotes correctly, using full PHP tags at all times, using white space properly, utilizing Yoda Conditions and so on.</li>
	<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/html/">HTML Coding Standards</a>&nbsp;refers to writing valid HTML code; using attribute values with lowercase characters, wrapping the attribute values with quotes, using white space with logical indentation, etc.</li>
	<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/css/">CSS Coding Standards</a>&nbsp;includes structuring the stylesheet properly, using lowercase names (with hyphens for separating words) in selectors, ordering the properties nicely, commenting and such.</li>
	<li><a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/javascript/">JavaScript Coding Standards</a>&nbsp;calls that we use&nbsp;braces appropriately, name functions and variables with <em>camelCase</em>, defining an anonymous function if jQuery is going to be used, and so forth.</li>
	<li><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review">Theme Review Standards</a>&nbsp;includes writing quality code (naturally), separating functionality by using plugins, utilizing template tags and hooks properly, supporting WordPress-generated CSS classes, securing the theme, licencing appropriately, organizing the theme files properly, writing a sufficient documentation... There's just too much!</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/">Theme Check</a> plugin inspects your theme about these standards – especially the "theme review" standards. The result may be both depressing and motivating, so don't give up hope and try to eliminate the errors to build a fantastic WordPress Theme.</p>

<p>Just as I started writing this article, a new website came out called <a href="http://themecheck.org/">ThemeCheck.org</a> which does exactly what the Theme Check plugin does. You don't have to install the Theme Check plugin; instead, you can upload your theme to the website and get your score along with recommendations to improve your theme (if it needs any). Plus, you can share your theme's validation score by placing the badge provided by them. Neat, isn't it?</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Validating your website is essential, no question about that. As long as you validate your web pages and maintain them to stay valid, you will only benefit from it.</p>

Her body of work, however, is barely touched through those tutorials and fantastically varied. Get an inside look at her background, process, and perspective in the interview below.</p><p class="question">Thanks so much for the interview. Let's start at the beginning: What got you into illustration and design?<br></p><p>I got into drawing early on via making comics, which was an early passion, and I drew my way through school quite literally – I used to have a drawing pad on my knees in class while dutifully taking notes on my desk! But this was Beirut in the 90's and there were no opportunities to learn and practice this professionally at the time, so I almost went into sciences instead.</p><p>It's at the very last minute, when it was time to send in my university application, that I learned of the existence of graphic design, then a newly available major in the country. This was just a couple of years after the arrival of the internet, as well, so the two together got me into this whole new world of creating for a living. If I had been born two years earlier, I'd have gone down a different path before these opportunities appeared.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/covephoto.jpg"></figure><p class="question">Who or what are your main sources of inspiration (either now or overall, over the years)?<br></p><p>I so dread this question!&nbsp;It's so difficult to answer, everything inspires me. Sometimes truly random things, such as a traffic incident that inspired&nbsp;<a href="http://majnouna-creation.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/driving-in-lebanon.html" target="_blank">a whole book</a>. Ethnography, animals, cooking, and baking make me want to draw. &nbsp;<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/unnamed-(5).jpg"><br></figure><p>On the calligraphy side, I get a lot of my ideas from Sufi texts, Jungian psychology, [and] even obscure words or the letters themselves. I'm also deeply interested in myths and where they interpenetrate reality, which comes out in my comic. When I practiced martial arts, that was a major source of inspiration, too.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/baklawa.jpg"></figure><p class="question">Did you study art or are you self-taught? Has this impacted the style of tutorials you've done for Tuts+ in any way?&nbsp;<br></p><p>A mixture of both, depending. I majored in graphic design, which equipped me with a host of skills, but I taught myself drawing, illustration, and comics from a young age and that impacts how I teach them, not being myself molded by a given approach.</p><p>Similarly, I went on to study calligraphy with a master, but this was old-style apprenticeship: no course, just intensive and varied work, so when it came to teaching it (as I will do on Tuts+ presently), I had to develop my own course structure and it brings together both my calligraphic and typographic backgrounds. And I still study now, when a specialized course comes up (such as working with gold), with specialized tutors.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/unnamed-(4).jpg"></figure><p>Mostly my tutorials, which in their original form are charts with minimal text, reflect how I like to organize and present information, and that owes much to a graphic design background (although at the time they tried very hard to squash illustration out of me). I adapt them for Tuts+ to a more text-based approach.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/unnamed-(3).jpg"></figure><p class="question">Your tutorials on Tuts+ are focused on anatomy and figure work. Your tutorials outside of the site are also focused on foundation drawing/basics. What led you to focusing on the building blocks of illustration and design when creating tutorials for others?</p><p>This would be due to the fact I began creating them on deviantART, which is a hotbed of aspiring artists, and I found we were all suffering from a lack of resources.&nbsp;There were books to learn to draw people, but they all seemed to be classics that were way too aged or complicated to help me in my time (save for Jack Hamm's, which I would still recommend), and in any case they were only accessible to those who could buy them.&nbsp;There were of course a lot of tutorials for the basics online, but most of them a waste of space, either really mediocre or covering too little to be any use.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/PastedGraphic-1.jpg"></figure><p>Not a lot of people can organize and present info in a straightforward and concise way – a great artist is not necessarily a good teacher, assuming they even have time to teach. And there were entire areas nobody was crazy enough to take up, such as how to draw different human types. I'm not a great artist, but I'm a great researcher and organizer of info, and I'm more than up for monumental enterprises. There was a clear lack and a real demand, which was motivation enough – also I needed these resources for myself, being focused on illustration and comics at the time.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/emotut.jpg"></figure><p class="question">A lot of your work seems to be focused on culture (either your own or others you enjoy). What brought about that focus? What messages are you keen on sending to viewers and readers in exploring these cultures?<br></p><p>I've traveled a lot, backpacking by myself through parts of the world where western culture has only had minimal impact so far. I'm very interested in traditional cultures, including mine which has sadly been largely suppressed by precocious westernization. They are far richer and deeper than this ultra-conformist society we no all live in.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/ethiopia0056.jpg"></figure><p>My focus on culture is largely for my own enjoyment, but I also hope it makes people shift their perception and become conscious that their Western culture is not the norm. It's shocking how many young Westerners, nowadays, think that their way of life is "the norm" and everything else is a deviation – whereas, seen in proper perspective, theirs is an aberration that just doesn't work.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/mada0006.jpg"></figure><p class="question">Your comic series, Malaak, is billed as “Lebanon’s first super hero comic”. For those unfamiliar (myself included) with the series, what is it about and what inspired you to create it?<br></p><p>The first and only! Malaak is set in a Lebanon that's perpetually at war (as it has been since before I was born), and the land's ancient guardians are so out of their depth they send one of their own in the shape of a human child to find out the cause of the war and put an end to it.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/V4.jpg"></figure><p>She becomes the super-heroine in question, a protector of civilians caught in the conflict, &nbsp;and the story has all the trappings of a superhero comic, except, as it turns out, there is a mythological background to it and several twists on the genre due to it being rooted in Lebanese culture and history.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/V12.jpg"></figure><p>What inspired it was the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War" target="_blank">2006 war</a>&nbsp;, where after sitting helpless under a constant blitz for a month, I needed an outlet for my rage and frustration. That outlet presented itself as a story, and 8 years later I have just one more volume to complete it! You can read it all on&nbsp;<a href="http://malaakonline.com/" target="_blank">malaakonline.com</a>.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/IV1.jpg"></figure><p class="question">&nbsp;What is your creative process like?<br></p><p>It always starts on paper. I have a slew of various sketchbooks&nbsp;and I always carry at least one with me. Ideas get scribbled, then sketched out more fully, and I go from there. If it's illustration, I typically scan the sketch in, make further modifications I need (such as resizing or repositioning), then print it out, and ink it on tracing paper. Then it can be scanned again for coloring.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/unnamed-(2).jpg"></figure><p>Sometimes I simply pencil and ink on paper without the intermediate steps – that's the case for my recipes, for instance. If it's calligraphy, I construct my sketch on Adobe Illustrator to make sure the geometry actually works, and to test scale and colours. When I'm satisfied, I construct it on paper and proceed to paint and gild. I don't print my designs and then transfer them!</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/unnamed-(1).jpg"></figure><p>The precision I demand requires proper geometric construction from scratch. It also means I design my pieces in such a way that I can construct them with a straight edge and a compass, so every element is placed in precise relationship with other elements.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/unnamed.jpg"></figure><p class="question">What programs and tools do you use in creating your work? Anything you're especially fond of that you'd like to recommend to readers?<br></p><p>A ball-point pen on paper is the beginning of all my work.&nbsp;An A5 [5.8" x 8.3"] sketchbook is my ideal size for this kind of thing, small enough to fit into my handbag but not so small it cramps my sketching.&nbsp;When you're at the idea or first visuals stage, you don't want anything to be distracting or in the way. You don't want to worry about misusing good paper, about pencils smudging, a stylus writing too slow, etc. You don't want to have to be sitting up at your computer desk, either. I do all my thinking work well away from my work space, either in coffeeshops or on the Tube. The informality helps the ideas come out.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/majnoun4.jpg"></figure><div><br></div><p>When I'm in my work space, it's time for actual labour; materials, and the proper attitude now become very important. For digital work, I rely almost entirely on the Adobe trinity: Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign (CS3 – I refused to upgrade further!). I almost didn't think of mentioning it because it's so indispensable to me, but I use a graphic tablet (Wacom Intuos, they last forever) – anyone serious about art and working digitally needs to get that first. It's also better for the hand in general than intensive use of a mouse. My trusty scanner is a Canon LIDE, which is is very inexpensive, very slender and can be stored on its side – handy when you have little room or keep moving house.</p><p>For real work, I use so many materials, but my best friends are tools I bought in '97 (!) when starting university: a professional-grade mechanical pencil, a good ruler, a cutting edge, and a very good compass. For inking, I use Faber Castell Ecco Pigment pens and brush pens I picked up in Japan.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/Working.jpg"></figure><p>It's hard to recommend anything in a void because it depends so much on what exactly you want to do. There's no need to amass resources, very often it's just this one or two things that are spot-on and can help you leap, while the rest is likely to sit and gather dust. For drawing people, for instance, other than&nbsp;<a href="http://majnouna.com/tutorials.html" target="_blank">my own book</a>&nbsp;which goes into human diversity like nobody else, Jack Hamm's&nbsp;<i>Drawing the Head and Figure</i>&nbsp;is so incredibly helpful; you could rely on just that and a lot of sketching from life. For making comics, I learned from French publications decades ago, but the DC Comics Guides are a very neat and practical little series. For hardware and software, a tablet is indispensable for digital art, as mentioned above, but there is a lot of free software that is very powerful and spares you the expense of Adobe stuff (from which I will bail someday). Yet the only tools you need to develop ideas and practice and improve on your skills are the basic pencil and paper. Don't get entangled in technology.</p><p class="question">Are you a freelancer, contract worker, or in-house employee? Is illustration/design your full-time gig?<br></p><p>I'm self-employed as an artist and occasionally do freelance work and various commissions. I'm a full-time artist but my focus is on calligraphy, and illustration is only a small part of what I do now – I mostly do it for pleasure and for my own products, more rarely for clients.&nbsp;</p><p class="question">What's your typical work day like? How about your work space? Can you give us an insight into how and where you work?<br></p><p>I don't actually have a typical work day, it all depends on whether I have a deadline or am following my own inspiration. If I'm in a busy production period, I wake up, do my yoga and meditation, then get to work with a cup of tea. A couple of hours later I pause for breakfast and get back to work till lunchtime, where I take a longer break to cook lunch. I get most of the work done in the morning because in the afternoon I usually start to flag, so I leave work that requires less focus for that time of day, and I may do it while listening to an audiobook or other entertainment. I never work overtime for clients, but I may stay up late working on something of my own, if I'm really excited about it. I have a daylight lamp that allows me to paint late into the night if I feel the drive.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/workspace.jpg"></figure><p>Here's my dual workspace in all its messy glory. Wherever I go, I need one desk for computer work (right) and one for painting, cutting and such (left). Efforts to keep either uncluttered are always futile. In-between you can glimpse my garden – I often have visitors while I work, squirrels or birds looking for a nibble!</p><p class="question">What words of advice do you have for emerging artists who wish to engage in illustration, design, and story-telling as you have?<br></p><p>Don't try to be anyone else. Don't try to be original at all costs, either. Ideas that come spontaneously and unlooked-for are usually the best: follow them. Don't become the slave of a specific style or tool. And if you can go to art school, do so, it'll get your foot in the door – otherwise you have to realize there's a lot of competition out there and it's hard to get noticed. Never delude yourself into thinking being an artist means you don't have to be practical – watch your finances, take breaks, eat well, balance work that inspired you and work that pays the bills, don't under-or oversell yourself, <b>don't work overtime</b>. Have a life, always. And be humble. Being an artist is a gift.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/117/posts/20889/image/a91fd84b6c3542e83e44bd535314a383-d5uhx5x.jpg"><figcaption><a href="http://majnouna.deviantart.com/art/My-Spiffy-Spice-Shelf-353555493" target="_self">"My Spiffy Spice Shelf,</a> Mac and PC Icon set.</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks so much, Joumana, for sharing your work, inspiration, and process with us.

Longtime users of <i>.Mac</i>, <i>MobileMe</i>, and <i>iCloud</i> can attest to this.&nbsp;That being said, the sheer convenience of such a well-integrated solution like iCloud is hard to beat.&nbsp;</p><p>In this Quick Tip, I'll show you&nbsp;how to get the best of both worlds by backing up your iCloud documents to any folder on or connected to a Mac. This could be the Dropbox or Google Drive Folder, a folder on a nearby NAS or just a folder sitting on the desktop.&nbsp;</p><h2>Screencast</h2><figure data-video-embed="true" data-original-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uyhv5YavfY" class="embedded-video">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0uyhv5YavfY?rel=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure><h2>Hazel 101<br></h2><p>To automate the backup process, you'll need a handy little tool called <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php" target="_self">Hazel</a> which provides automated organization for the Mac. It's only $28 and it would really be a steal at twice the price. The application works as a <b>System Preferences</b> Pane, automatically filing, organizing and cleaning your files.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you've purchased and installed Hazel, you can head over to <b>System Preferences</b> to get started. To launch Hazel, just click on it's preference pane icon.&nbsp;</p><h2>Selecting the Mobile Documents Folder</h2><p>The backup you create will be of the Mobile Documents folder, which is where Apple keeps your iCloud documents. Apple does a pretty good job of keeping this out of view from the average user, but it's not at all difficult to find if you know where to look.&nbsp;</p><p>First, open up <b>Finder</b>. Next, right click&nbsp;on any empty space and select <b>Show View Options</b>.&nbsp;Here, no surprise, you'll be given an overview of &nbsp;some viewing options for the Home folder.&nbsp;</p><p>Select <b>Show Library Folder</b> as that's where the <b>Mobile Documents</b> folder is hiding. Once selected, you'll see that the <b>Library</b> has appeared in the <b>Home folder</b> and you're ready to move forward.&nbsp;</p><h2>Creating the Perfect Rule</h2><p>With the <b>Library</b> folder unhidden, you can head back to <b>Hazel</b> and add the <b>Mobile Documents</b> folder to your list of actionable folders. Now that you've selected a folder to run some rules on, it's time to craft your rule.&nbsp;</p><p>A rule is composed of two parts, the&nbsp;<b>If Statement</b>&nbsp;and the <b>Do&nbsp;Statement</b>. In the following steps, I'll show you how to properly use both to create a rule that will backup the <b>Mobile Documents</b> folder.</p><p>First, give your rule a name. Choose something clear and understandable should you need to go back to it in order to change something.&nbsp;</p><p>Now you can define your&nbsp;<b>If Statement</b>. The broadest possible&nbsp;<b>If Statement</b>&nbsp;is one that monitors all files. To create this,&nbsp;select <b>Any File</b> from Hazel's drop down menu.&nbsp;If you'd like to exclude certain files from your backup, change the&nbsp;<b>If Statement</b>&nbsp;to <b>If None</b> instead of<b> </b><b>If Any</b>. This will instruct Hazel to look for files or folders with a specific name to exclude. Find the exact name of the folder you'd like to exclude and copy that into Hazel's text field.</p><p>Your <b>If Statement</b> should look something like this:</p><p><code class="inline"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">If <b>None</b> of the following conditions are met:&nbsp;<b>Name</b> <b>is&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span><i><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">folder name</span></i></code></p><p>The&nbsp;<b>Do&nbsp;Statement</b>&nbsp;is going to tell Hazel exactly what operations you'd like it to perform. You can use this to tell Hazel to duplicate the contents of the <b>Mobile Documents</b> folder.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<b>Do&nbsp;Statement</b>&nbsp;should look like this:</p><p><code class="inline">Do the&nbsp;following&nbsp;to the matched file or folder: <b>Copy</b> to the folder: <i>folder name</i></code></p><p>Next, select <b>Options</b> and choose <b>replace the existing file</b>. Finally, select the checkbox labelled <b>do not copy if a duplicate</b>.</p><p>When you press <b>OK</b>, your rule that instructs Hazel to backup the iCloud files to a folder will have been created.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It's important to remember that this solution only backs up the most recent version of any given iCloud file. Therefore, for maximum protection, use a tool like <b>Time Machine</b> which will handle multiple versions of your iCloud files.&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind and&nbsp;a Hazel backup of your iCloud files running at regular intervals, you can rest easy knowing that your important data is not being held&nbsp;<i>solely</i>&nbsp;by Apple.</p><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21414/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21414/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21414/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21414/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-13T12:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-13T12:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

The nunchuck is a good multi-use input for a Raspberry Pi as they can be picked up cheaply and contain a joystick, a three-axis 
accelerometer and two buttons in a nice ergonomically friendly controller.</p><h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To get the nunchuck running with the Pi, you will need:<br></p><ul><li>A
Raspberry Pi with SD card preinstalled with Raspbian (refer to the tutorial <i><a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-flash-an-sd-card-for-raspberry-pi--mac-53600" target="_self">How to Flash an SD Card for Raspberry Pi</a></i> if you need to)</li><li>A
Nintendo nunchuck

</li><li>An
adaptor such as <a href="http://www.boeeerb.co.uk/product/multichuck-adaptor/" target="_self">MultiChuck</a></li><li>Or female jumper wires, soldering iron, solder and electrical tape to cover the joint<br></li></ul>

<h2>Hooking up your Nunchuck</h2><p>If you are feeling brave, enjoy cutting the connectors off and have spare controllers you can hook the wires directly up to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. As each connector may use different coloured wires, it is best to open the controller to work out the wiring colours.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/228/posts/20984/image/nunchuck-wiring.jpg"><br><figcaption>Wiring the&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<p>In my controller I have the following wires, as this is a third-party controller, take note of the 
colours and the pins to which&nbsp;they connect, as the chances are they could be very different to the connector in my example.<br></p><ul><li><b>Ground</b>–Brown</li><li><b>Serial Data</b>–Pink</li><li><b>Serial Clock</b>–Yellow</li><li><b>Power (VDD)</b>–White</li><li><b>Addon Detect</b>–Blue–Not used</li></ul><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/228/posts/20984/image/nunchuck-pi-wiring.png"><figcaption>An example of the wiring pinout</figcaption></figure><p>Cut off the end connector that you plug into the Wiimote, strip back the plastic coating to expose the bare wires. Solder each wire to a female jumper wire, then use electrical tape to protect the soldered joints from touching each other. Once you are sure each colour matches its respective wire, plug them straight on to the i2c and power pins on the Pi.</p><p>If you aren't feeling that brave, or you don't have a controller to spare, you can always use an adaptor such as the MultiChuck Adaptor to connect your controller to your Pi without sacrificing the connector.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/228/posts/20984/image/nunchuck-multichuck.jpg"><figcaption>Using a MultiChuck adapter</figcaption></figure><h2>Setting Up the Raspberry Pi</h2><p>i2c isn't enabled by default, this requires the editing of two&nbsp;files. The first file will enable the serial protocol and the second will start the serial driver when the Raspberry Pi boots up.</p><p>To edit the first file, type this in to the <b>LXTerminal</b> window or <b>PuTTY</b> if you are connecting remotely: <code>sudo nano /etc/modules</code></p><p>Add <code class="inline">i2c-dev</code> and <code class="inline">i2c-bcm2708</code> to the end of the file so it looks like this:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/228/posts/20984/image/etc-modules.png"><figcaption>Editing files on the Raspberry Pi</figcaption></figure><p><b>Control-X</b> to save the changes, <b>Y</b> to confirm and <b>Enter</b> to save to the file.</p><p>Next, to&nbsp;enable the driver on start up, type:</p><pre class="brush: bash">sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf</pre><p>then add a <code class="inline">#</code> to the beginning of each line so it looks&nbsp;like this:<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/228/posts/20984/image/etc-blacklist.png"><br><figcaption>Editing files on the Raspberry Pi</figcaption></figure><p>Again&nbsp;<b>Control-X</b>&nbsp;to save the changes,&nbsp;<b>Y</b>&nbsp;to confirm and&nbsp;<b>Enter</b>&nbsp;to save to the file.&nbsp;Those are&nbsp;the changes needed to for the Raspberry Pi to talk over the i2c protocol. Next type:</p><pre class="brush: bash">sudo reboot restart</pre><p>to allow the changes to take effect.</p>

<h2>Installing the Required Libraries</h2><p>Once the Raspberry Pi has restarted, open LXTerminal again. The last thing to do now is to install the Python modules to handle the communication between Python and i2c:</p><pre class="brush: bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-smbus -y</pre><p>To make handling the nunchuck data easier, I have created a module that can be imported in to your script. Open&nbsp;<b>LXTerminal</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;type the following command to download it.</p><pre class="brush: bash">wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Boeeerb/Nunchuck/master/Raspberry%20Pi/nunchuck.py</pre><p>Reading Nunchuck Data<br></p><p>Now you have all the libraries and modules required, test that it works. Whilst still in <b>LXTerminal</b>, type in</p><pre class="brush: bash">sudo python</pre><p>to start the interactive Python console, using this we can write a quick test with Python.&nbsp;</p><pre class="brush: bash">from nunchuck import nunchuck

<h2><span class="sectionnum">1.</span> Restack</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>The very first extension in fact is <b>Restack </b>and it's quite useful if you happen to have a bunch of overlaying objects.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-1.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>What Restack does is change the z-index of each object to your desired specifications. Go ahead and select your objects then head up to <b>Extensions &gt; Arrange &gt; Restack</b> to open up the dialog box. As you can see below, my diamonds are already stacked from <b>Left to Right</b>, so nothing changes here.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-2.png"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>The <b>Restack Direction</b> has a good amount of options, all of which are self-explanatory. I've selected <b>Bottom to Top</b> and as long as you have <b>Live preview </b>checked, you'll notice the changes right away. This option starts stacking from bottom to top according to each shapes Top-Left bounding box corner.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-3.png"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>The other option that differs is <b>Arbitrary Angle</b>, where you get to define an <b>Angle</b> in which to stack. <b>215</b> degrees stacked my shapes from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner.</p><p>A slight issue I came across personally was that <b>Live preview </b>wouldn't work unless I unchecked and rechecked it after every time I changed something.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-4.png"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">2.</span> Color Extensions<br></h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>There are a bunch of options in <b>Extensions &gt; Color</b>, but they're all very straight forward. I'll compare my original drawing with a color adjusted one. Below, I've selected <b>Grayscale</b>.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-5.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>And here, I selected individual parts of my drawing to make <b>Brighter</b> and <b>Darker</b> for some quick shading.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-6.png"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Of course, we can see the <b>Negative</b> of our drawings as well.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-7.png"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>Or just go crazy with <b>Randomize</b>!<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-8.png"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3><p>One of my favorites is <b>Replace</b> color, which is easily used by entering old and new hex color codes.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-9.png"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">3.</span> Extrude</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>This is a great way to take any two shapes and turn them into a extruded 3D object. Go ahead and select two shapes in which to extrude and head up to <b>Extensions &gt; Generate from Path &gt; Extrude</b> to bring up the dialog box.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-10.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>I'm going to check<b> Polygons</b> and <b>Live preview</b> to give me what you see below. This new extruded part of your object is actually a separate group of polygons (which can be edited to your liking).<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-11.png"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>The less glamorous option is <b>Lines</b>, which simply draws the extrusion lines.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-12.png"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">4.</span> Interpolate</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>A fancy word to fill in the space between two paths with the gradual placement of specified paths. Go ahead and select a couple of objects/paths and click <b>Extensions &gt; Generate from Path &gt; Interpolate</b>.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-13.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Let's check <b>Live preview </b>and watch the magic happen! <b>Interpolation steps</b> is the number of paths to place between the two selected objects. I also unchecked <b>Duplicate endpaths</b> because redrawing my original shapes seems unnecessary.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-14.png"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>I went ahead and packed <b>8 Interpolation steps</b> in there along with an added <b>Exponent</b> of <b>1.0 </b>which exponentially increases/decreases the position of the steps.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-15.png"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>And if our two original objects happened to have different styles, we could go ahead and check <b>Interpolate style</b>.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-16.png"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">5.</span> Embed/Extract Images</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>If you've ever imported a bitmap into Inkscape, it's likely you've seen this dialog box before. It simply asks you if you'd like to embed the image or link it. I say, let's link it to keep or file size down... but what if that was the wrong decision?<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-17.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>It might seem like I have my beautiful guitar picture locked in, but before you know it...<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-18.png"></figure><p>Bam! I accidentally renamed or deleted my image or something and you end up with the saddest image of all.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-19.png"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Thankfully, next time I link an image and decide I want to embed it, I can just head up to <b>Extensions &gt; Images &gt; Embed Images</b>. You can either embed all of your images, or individually select the ones you want.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-20.png"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>Alternatively, you can go ahead and click <b>Extract Image</b> instead. This is nice if you happen to pass your Inkscape document on to somebody else and they want your source image.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-21.png"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">6.</span> Envelope and Perspective</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Now, you'll need a secondary path to use as a guide for these operations. Make sure it only contains four corners and only straight lines. Go ahead, and select both objects and head up to <b>Extensions &gt; Modify Path</b> to find both <b>Envelope</b> and <b>Perspective</b>.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-22.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>These are both essentially the same operation, except that perspective applies the extra effect. Below, I have my <b>Envelope transformation </b>and my <b>Perspective transformation</b>, respectively. You can see the difference - envelope just sort of crams your object into a path while perspective keeps the shape proportionate to the perspective.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-23.png"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">7.</span> Other Useful Modify Path</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>If you've ever used markers on paths, then you know they're always black no matter what. Fortunately, <b>Extensions &gt; Modify Path &gt; Color Markers to Match Stroke</b> is a terrific way to do this!<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-24.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>And if you've ever applied dashes as a stroke style, there may have come a time where you'd like to separate them as individual paths. Well, here comes <b>Extensions &gt; Modify Path &gt; Convert to Dashes</b>. The name is a little misleading as it's not converting to dashes - it already is dashes. I think Dashes to Paths would be a more suitable name perhaps.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-25.png"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">8.</span> Render</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>If you ever need a barcode for your package design, simply head up to <b>Extensions &gt; Render &gt; Barcode</b>. There's a bunch of coding options and the rest is simple.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-26.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Perhaps you've needed to create a completely customized calendar in, say, 5 seconds? Amazingly, you can do just that by clicking <b>Extensions &gt; Render &gt; Calendar</b>. There's a bunch of options for styling as well. How cool is this?<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-27.png"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Also, if you've ever wanted to include a grid in your drawing, <b>Extensions &gt; Render &gt; Grid</b> is the way to do it. It's also a great way to draw tables!<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/116/posts/20622/image/extensions-28.png"></figure><h2>That's It!</h2><p>We just went over a bunch of Inkscape extensions - can you believe there's even more? Hopefully, this narrowed down list of the most useful extensions will help you get around Inkscape more efficiently. Some of these extensions are just plain cool though!

Ambiance is a light theme that looks a bit more Mac-like, while Radiance is the darker brown theme used in Ubuntu by default.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Ubuntu Radiance theme" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/Radiance.jpg"><figcaption>Radiance theme look</figcaption></figure><h2>Launcher Icon Size</h2><p>You can also change the<b>&nbsp;</b>size of the<strong> Unity Launcher icons</strong> in the left-side toolbar.&nbsp;Simply click on the&nbsp;little slider below the theme options and drag it to the left to reduce icon size, or drag it to the right to increase the size.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="small launcher icons" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/icons-small.jpg"><figcaption>Small Launcher icons</figcaption></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Big launcher icons" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/icons-big.jpg"><figcaption>Big Launcher icons</figcaption></figure><p>In Ubuntu, your icons can be as small as&nbsp;<strong>16px</strong>&nbsp;wide and as large as&nbsp;<strong>64px&nbsp;</strong>wide. Ubuntu uses resized&nbsp;<em>png</em>&nbsp;images that are automatically loaded while we moving slider button, so you can see the results right away without losing any quality in the icons.</p><h2>Changing Behavior settings</h2><p>The second tab under <b>Appearance</b> settings&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Behavior</strong>,&nbsp;where we can change some basic settings for the&nbsp;<strong>Unity launcher</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>top menu bar</strong>&nbsp;behavior. You can&nbsp;auto-hide the Unity launcher, enable the workspaces and&nbsp;<i>Show Desktop</i> icon, and choose where to locate the window menus from your apps, a new option in Ubuntu 14.04.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Image behavior" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/Behavior.jpg"><figcaption>Behavior tab</figcaption></figure><h3>Auto-hide the Launcher</h3><p>If you want to extend your Desktop space for couple of more pixels, you can hide your Unity Launcher. All we have to do is to&nbsp;click&nbsp;the&nbsp;On/Off button&nbsp;at top right corner inside Behavior tab, and Unity Launcher will be&nbsp;<strong>hidden</strong>&nbsp;right away.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="Hide launcher" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/Hiden-Launcher.jpg"></figure><p>Then, you can bring back the Unity Launcher by moving your desktop to the&nbsp;<b>Reveal location</b> of your choice: the left side of the screen, or just the top left corner. Pick the option you want, then set the&nbsp;<b>Reveal Sensitivity</b> slider to the level you want to have your launcher come back quickly or slower.</p><p><b>Tip</b>: never&nbsp;set the reveal&nbsp;sensitivity at the&nbsp;<strong>lowest</strong>&nbsp;level because it will make it hard to get the launcher back.<br></p><h3>Workspaces and showing desktop</h3><p>Another great option that Ubuntu offers is enabling the&nbsp;<strong>Workspaces</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Show desktop</strong>&nbsp;icons. Both of them are very useful when we are working with a lot of opened Windows and we need extra space or to minimize all Windows at once and/or show the desktop.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="desktop icons" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/Enable-worspace-desktop.jpg"><figcaption>Workspace and Desktop icons</figcaption></figure><p>To enable both (or one of those) icons, all we have to do is to&nbsp;<strong>check little box</strong>&nbsp;and icon will be shown in Unity Launcher right away.</p><p><strong>Workspaces</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>virtual desktop</strong>&nbsp;is great Linux feature to provide us with more space, like extra "virtual" monitors. Simply by&nbsp;clicking&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<strong>Workspaces </strong>icon&nbsp;in Launcher, our screen will be divided into&nbsp;4 workspaces. Select a desktop to work inside it, or drag one of your open apps to another desktop to use it there. Then, click the Workspaces icon again to jump back to another workspace. This is a great way to keep your work organized and not get overwhelmed when working with a ton of apps.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="workspaces" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/Workspaces.jpg"><figcaption>Workspaces preview</figcaption></figure><h3>Show the menus for a window</h3><p>New in Ubuntu 14.04 is an option to choose&nbsp;where window menu will be shown. In previous versions of Ubuntu window menu was showed&nbsp;<strong>in the top menu bar</strong>, much like on a Mac. If you've just switched to Ubuntu from a PC, though, it'll make more sense to have your menus inside your windows themselves. That's why there's now an option to have your menus either in the menubar or the window title bar.</p><p>By default, your menus will show up in the menubar along the top of your desktop, but if you switch it to the window's title bar, they'll show up right beside your window buttons, much more like in Windows.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="menu bar" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/in-the-menu-bar.jpg"><figcaption>In the menu bar</figcaption></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="window title bar" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/355/posts/21316/image/In-the-window-menu.jpg"><figcaption>In the windows title bar</figcaption></figure><h3>Restore Behavior Settings</h3><p>The best thing is, you can never mess up your desktop the whole way. If anything feels wrong after you've tweaked your settings, there's a button at the bottom of the dialog for you:&nbsp;<b>Restore Behavior Settings</b>. &nbsp;Click this, and everything will be reverted to the default settings.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Ubuntu gives you most of options you could want to customize your desktop to look the way you want. From changing your wallpaper and themes to some basic behavior settings in the desktop and more, you can get Ubuntu looking and working the way you want. It might still take you a bit to get used to, but at least you'll feel at home with it customized just for you.</p><p>Feel free to play around with settings until you get desktop look that's perfect for you—and we'd love to see your customized Ubuntu desktops in the comments below!</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21316/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21316/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21316/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21316/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-13T08:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-13T08:00:00.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

Learn how to cross stitch with this easy step-by-step tutorial.</p><h2>Supplies</h2><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/crossstitchsupplies.jpg"></figure><ul><li>Aida cross stitch fabric</li><li>Scissors</li><li>Embroidery needle</li><li>Embroidery thread (floss)</li><li>Embroidery hoop</li></ul><h2><span class="sectionnum">1.</span> Prepare Your Fabric for Stitching</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Secure your fabric into your embroidery hoop. Aida fabric is made specifically for cross stitching, and has a grid pattern that is easy to see and use for counting stitches. It also has some stabilizer or starchiness to it, so it's quite stiff compared to a standard cotton fabric. Make sure you secure the fabric into the hoop tightly so it doesn't shift while stitching, which can warp your final project.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/secureaidainhoop.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Thread your needle with embroidery thread (also called floss). If you are using an Aida cloth that has a very small tight grid pattern, you may decide to split the floss into fewer than six strands to give your individual stitches definition.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/threadneedle.jpg"></figure><h2>2. Begin Your Stitch<br></h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Cross stitch is named because each stitch is a tiny 'x' or cross. The patterns are laid out on a grid (usually color coded) and you don't typically need to do any kind of pattern transfer. Choose your first color and a good starting point in your pattern (some people like to work from the center outward; others choose to work from top to bottom and left to right, as if reading a book).&nbsp; <br></p><p>Start your stitch by coming up through the fabric from back to front in one corner of your 'x'. Pull the floss through, leaving a small tail on the back side of your work, which you can later weave into the final project to keep it neat.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/stitchstep1.jpg"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/step1.1.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Complete the first half of your stitch by taking the needle back through your fabric from front to back in the opposite corner (I started my stitch on the bottom left corner, so I will pass my needle back through in the top right corner). To keep your work neat, always start each individual stitch in the same corner and complete in the same corner (I tend to start all my crosses on the bottom left, but any corner will work as long as you are consistent).</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/stitchstep2.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Complete a single cross stitch by coming back up from back to front in the bottom right corner of your square, then passing back through front to back in the top left corner.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/crossstitchstep3.jpg"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/crossstitccomplete.jpg"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">3.</span> Stitch a Row of Crosses</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Most patterns will have areas where the same color spans several blocks in a row. To complete a full row of cross stitch, do the first half of each cross or 'x' before crossing the stitches (each of my stitches started at the bottom left corner of an 'x). By doing this, you will start and end your row on the same side.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/crossstitchline.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Complete the row by crossing over each stitch until you are back at the beginning of the row. In the row I stitched, each stitch started at the bottom right of an 'x' and was worked from right to left.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/crossstitchlinestep2.jpg"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/crossstitchrowfinal.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>When you turn your work over to look at the back, you will notice it is a neat row of lines, which you can easily weave any excess floss into.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/187/posts/20695/image/crossstitchback.jpg"></figure><h2>Practice Your Cross Stitch</h2><p>With a bit of practice, you can be a pro at cross stitch in no time.

There are games that look better with less. There are games that look amazing empty and minimalistic. However, if you are looking to make something with a bit more <i>oomph</i>, the following should help you on your way.</p><p>All too often,&nbsp;I see promising games held back because the developers didn't spend enough time developing the space their game takes place in. Games with bland worlds that lack a sense of wonder or intrigue. To fix&nbsp;this is normally seen as a huge undertaking that is outside of a developer's&nbsp;skills, but&nbsp;this is absolutely not true—it just takes a little imagination to use art assets to make a vibrant and living world.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Forest.png"></figure><p>For example, this game world was &nbsp;made with only two tree models. And as for the trees themselves: they're each&nbsp;simply a sphere on a cylinder (both with reduced vertices). Easy art with a big impact.<br></p><h2>Creating Assets to Use</h2><h3>What Kinds of Assets Should You&nbsp;Make?</h3><p>In order to create environments that look polished, you are going to need assets. Before you start creating things, you must first figure out and understand what is needed in order to give life to your world. What inhabits your world? What sort of feeling do you want your world to have?</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Raybit 600.png"></figure><p>In the picture above, we can see that the world in my game, <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/rabytt/25464/" target="_self">Rabytt</a>, is filled with flowers. That's it—and I used these flowers because I wanted to create a uplifting, loving feeling in the game. However, keep in mind that these flowers were easy to create (albeit time consuming), and went a long way in creating a more polished and vibrant world.</p><h3>Create a Story With Your Assets</h3><p>When you are deciding on your assets, make sure to create a story with them. Everything you add to your game has an impact on the player's view of your game world. So, before you start making the assets, first create a list of things that would populate your world.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you in a space station? Then wires, vents, buttons and dials, and computer panels all come to mind when I'm thinking of a space station. Is the space station destroyed? Then these things might appear broken. Create a list of things that would populate your world.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Monaco.png"><figcaption><a href="http://www.monacoismine.com/" target="_self">Monaco</a> is a great example of using a small number&nbsp;of assets to achieve&nbsp;a big payoff.</figcaption></figure><p>Do you have that list? Yeah? Okay, good. Now pick three things from that list.</p><p>"Whoa! But what about all this other stuff that's in this world?" you say. Well, hush: ever hear the saying "less is more?" If you were to try to create more than the three things it would:</p><ol><li>end up becoming a big undertaking, which defeats the purpose of this tutorial&nbsp;</li><li>make it harder&nbsp;to create a visual vocabulary</li><li>make it difficult&nbsp;for accents to your world to stand out and create a more powerful atmosphere</li></ol><h3>Keep it Consistent</h3><p>By now, you may have&nbsp;noticed that I haven't talked about how to actually physically <i>create</i> the art yet. That's because I'm not writing this to teach you how to draw. You as a designer must understand the limits of what is possible for you to do. Can't create amazing painterly style art? Go with pixel art. Can't do pixel art? Well that's a lie, everyone can do pixel art. <a href="http://pixelartus.com/tagged/pixel-art-tutorials" rel="external" target="_blank">You just need to start doing it.</a></p><p>Now that that's out of the way, the most important thing that you can do is make sure that all of your art shares the same <i>style</i>. I'm sure that once you get to the point where you need to populate your game with assets, you will already have a style in place. Make sure that the art adheres to that style. If it doesn't look quite right the first time around, do it over. Take pride in making sure that your game looks as good as you can make it.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Rabytt.png"><figcaption>To polish my game's overall look, I only used these simple, easy-to-make flowers.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also important&nbsp;to make sure that for each asset you create slight variations of that asset. Color variations, little markings, different sizes and shapes. Nothing too big, but small changes can go a long way in making sure that the player still recognizes objects without noticing patterns.</p><h2>Now What?</h2><h3>Where Should You Place the Art?</h3><p>Short answer: Everywhere.</p><p>Long answer: Everywhere.</p><p>Basically, don't be stingy with what you have. Put them everywhere that you can put them. However, be careful. You need a point at which you stop putting down objects. The best judge of that would be yourself and the type of atmosphere you game is aiming for.&nbsp;There will be a point where you feel like "this is enough".</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Rabytt 1.png"><figcaption>In my mind it felt weird to place flowers on the ceiling and walls, but I'm glad I&nbsp;stuck to it. Don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><p>Use rotation and&nbsp;scale, flip them, do everything you can possibly think with them (as long as it fits your aesthetic).&nbsp;Holding back will stop you from coming up with some truly unique worlds.</p><h3>Avoid Saturation</h3><p>Do be careful with how much of the same asset you use in any one&nbsp;area. The reason you should create variations of the same assets is so you can ensure&nbsp;that the player won't notice patterns in the world. In the picture above, I used one asset twelve times in the scene—I just used variations in color, scale, and rotation to keep the player&nbsp;from realizing it.</p><p>Use the variations to break up patterns and stop the player from recognizing and getting bored of the same visuals over and over again. If you catch yourself using the same asset multiple times in the same area, try switching it out for a variation of that asset. The player will stop noticing the pattern and start seeing a world.</p><h2>Fleshing Out the World</h2><h3>Sealing the Seams of the Game World</h3><p>Seams are the parts of the world that don't look finished, or that feel like they're&nbsp;missing something. Obviously the first step in fixing this is finding out what is missing. Is a space in your world feeling empty? Is it boring? Too visually busy?</p><p>This is hard to address, because it can easily change from game to game and really depends on the art style of the game. Sometimes empty is good. Sometimes boring is good. But this comes down to your own choices as a designer.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Rabytt 2.png"><figcaption>In this particular game, for me, the seam&nbsp;was the background. It was empty (even with the trees), so I just used the flowers I made before, except this time silhouetted.</figcaption></figure><p>If there is something you feel is out of place, then figure out what it is and see if any of your existing assets can fill in the problem.</p><h3>Special Art Assets</h3><p>Special art assets are things that accent your world.; they give it life and a story that can't be told with words. These are one-offs, but they are extremely powerful in leaving&nbsp;impressions on the player of what your world is like.</p><p>These are assets that you only use once, tentatively twice, throughout your entire game. These assets&nbsp;are specific, and can't be generalized. Most of the time, you'll see these types of assets used for story purposes.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Papers Please.png"><figcaption>In <a href="http://papersplea.se/" target="_self">Papers, Please</a>, this style of passport is used only once. However, it communicates so much to the player about the world and the people in it.</figcaption></figure><p>Try to distil pieces of what you are trying to communicate to the player about your game into these art assets. Also, keep in mind exactly where you will be placing them. These aren't pieces of art that can be placed randomly; timing and position is important. However, this is something that is different for each game, so it is up to you as a designer to figure out how to get the most bang for your buck in these situations.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Don't ever assume that just because you aren't the world's greatest artist, or because you are strapped for time, that you can't create some beautiful game worlds.&nbsp;With a few simple art assets and a few moments to spread that art&nbsp;around as you go along, you will end up with a great, polished&nbsp;game world.</p><h2>References</h2><ul><li>Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine screenshot from <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/review/monaco-whats-yours-is-mine-review/" target="_self">PC Gamer's review</a>.</li><li>Papers Please screenshot from <a href="http://www.dorkadia.com/2013/08/15/papers-please/" target="_self">Dorkadia's review</a>.</li></ul><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21012/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21012/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21012/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21012/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-12T15:47:38.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-12T15:47:38.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"
