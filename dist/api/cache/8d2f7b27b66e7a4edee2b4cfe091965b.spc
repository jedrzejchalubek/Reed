In this tutorial, I'll show you how you can easily crank the polish of your world up a couple of notches—this will go a long way towards capturing the imagination of players!<br></p><p><i>Disclaimer:</i> Not every game will benefit from this article. There are games that look better with less. There are games that look amazing empty and minimalistic. However, if you are looking to make something with a bit more <i>oomph</i>, the following should help you on your way.</p><p>All too often,&nbsp;I see promising games held back because the developers didn't spend enough time developing the space their game takes place in. Games with bland worlds that lack a sense of wonder or intrigue. To fix&nbsp;this is normally seen as a huge undertaking that is outside of a developer's&nbsp;skills, but&nbsp;this is absolutely not true—it just takes a little imagination to use art assets to make a vibrant and living world.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Forest.png"></figure><p>For example, this game world was &nbsp;made with only two tree models. And as for the trees themselves: they're each&nbsp;simply a sphere on a cylinder (both with reduced vertices). Easy art with a big impact.<br></p><h2>Creating Assets to Use</h2><h3>What Kinds of Assets Should You&nbsp;Make?</h3><p>In order to create environments that look polished, you are going to need assets. Before you start creating things, you must first figure out and understand what is needed in order to give life to your world. What inhabits your world? What sort of feeling do you want your world to have?</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Raybit 600.png"></figure><p>In the picture above, we can see that the world in my game, <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/rabytt/25464/" target="_self">Rabytt</a>, is filled with flowers. That's it—and I used these flowers because I wanted to create a uplifting, loving feeling in the game. However, keep in mind that these flowers were easy to create (albeit time consuming), and went a long way in creating a more polished and vibrant world.</p><h3>Create a Story With Your Assets</h3><p>When you are deciding on your assets, make sure to create a story with them. Everything you add to your game has an impact on the player's view of your game world. So, before you start making the assets, first create a list of things that would populate your world.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you in a space station? Then wires, vents, buttons and dials, and computer panels all come to mind when I'm thinking of a space station. Is the space station destroyed? Then these things might appear broken. Create a list of things that would populate your world.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Monaco.png"><figcaption><a href="http://www.monacoismine.com/" target="_self">Monaco</a> is a great example of using a small number&nbsp;of assets to achieve&nbsp;a big payoff.</figcaption></figure><p>Do you have that list? Yeah? Okay, good. Now pick three things from that list.</p><p>"Whoa! But what about all this other stuff that's in this world?" you say. Well, hush: ever hear the saying "less is more?" If you were to try to create more than the three things it would:</p><ol><li>end up becoming a big undertaking, which defeats the purpose of this tutorial&nbsp;</li><li>make it harder&nbsp;to create a visual vocabulary</li><li>make it difficult&nbsp;for accents to your world to stand out and create a more powerful atmosphere</li></ol><h3>Keep it Consistent</h3><p>By now, you may have&nbsp;noticed that I haven't talked about how to actually physically <i>create</i> the art yet. That's because I'm not writing this to teach you how to draw. You as a designer must understand the limits of what is possible for you to do. Can't create amazing painterly style art? Go with pixel art. Can't do pixel art? Well that's a lie, everyone can do pixel art. <a href="http://pixelartus.com/tagged/pixel-art-tutorials" rel="external" target="_blank">You just need to start doing it.</a></p><p>Now that that's out of the way, the most important thing that you can do is make sure that all of your art shares the same <i>style</i>. I'm sure that once you get to the point where you need to populate your game with assets, you will already have a style in place. Make sure that the art adheres to that style. If it doesn't look quite right the first time around, do it over. Take pride in making sure that your game looks as good as you can make it.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Rabytt.png"><figcaption>To polish my game's overall look, I only used these simple, easy-to-make flowers.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also important&nbsp;to make sure that for each asset you create slight variations of that asset. Color variations, little markings, different sizes and shapes. Nothing too big, but small changes can go a long way in making sure that the player still recognizes objects without noticing patterns.</p><h2>Now What?</h2><h3>Where Should You Place the Art?</h3><p>Short answer: Everywhere.</p><p>Long answer: Everywhere.</p><p>Basically, don't be stingy with what you have. Put them everywhere that you can put them. However, be careful. You need a point at which you stop putting down objects. The best judge of that would be yourself and the type of atmosphere you game is aiming for.&nbsp;There will be a point where you feel like "this is enough".</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Rabytt 1.png"><figcaption>In my mind it felt weird to place flowers on the ceiling and walls, but I'm glad I&nbsp;stuck to it. Don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><p>Use rotation and&nbsp;scale, flip them, do everything you can possibly think with them (as long as it fits your aesthetic).&nbsp;Holding back will stop you from coming up with some truly unique worlds.</p><h3>Avoid Saturation</h3><p>Do be careful with how much of the same asset you use in any one&nbsp;area. The reason you should create variations of the same assets is so you can ensure&nbsp;that the player won't notice patterns in the world. In the picture above, I used one asset twelve times in the scene—I just used variations in color, scale, and rotation to keep the player&nbsp;from realizing it.</p><p>Use the variations to break up patterns and stop the player from recognizing and getting bored of the same visuals over and over again. If you catch yourself using the same asset multiple times in the same area, try switching it out for a variation of that asset. The player will stop noticing the pattern and start seeing a world.</p><h2>Fleshing Out the World</h2><h3>Sealing the Seams of the Game World</h3><p>Seams are the parts of the world that don't look finished, or that feel like they're&nbsp;missing something. Obviously the first step in fixing this is finding out what is missing. Is a space in your world feeling empty? Is it boring? Too visually busy?</p><p>This is hard to address, because it can easily change from game to game and really depends on the art style of the game. Sometimes empty is good. Sometimes boring is good. But this comes down to your own choices as a designer.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Rabytt 2.png"><figcaption>In this particular game, for me, the seam&nbsp;was the background. It was empty (even with the trees), so I just used the flowers I made before, except this time silhouetted.</figcaption></figure><p>If there is something you feel is out of place, then figure out what it is and see if any of your existing assets can fill in the problem.</p><h3>Special Art Assets</h3><p>Special art assets are things that accent your world.; they give it life and a story that can't be told with words. These are one-offs, but they are extremely powerful in leaving&nbsp;impressions on the player of what your world is like.</p><p>These are assets that you only use once, tentatively twice, throughout your entire game. These assets&nbsp;are specific, and can't be generalized. Most of the time, you'll see these types of assets used for story purposes.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/313/posts/21012/image/Papers Please.png"><figcaption>In <a href="http://papersplea.se/" target="_self">Papers, Please</a>, this style of passport is used only once. However, it communicates so much to the player about the world and the people in it.</figcaption></figure><p>Try to distil pieces of what you are trying to communicate to the player about your game into these art assets. Also, keep in mind exactly where you will be placing them. These aren't pieces of art that can be placed randomly; timing and position is important. However, this is something that is different for each game, so it is up to you as a designer to figure out how to get the most bang for your buck in these situations.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Don't ever assume that just because you aren't the world's greatest artist, or because you are strapped for time, that you can't create some beautiful game worlds.&nbsp;With a few simple art assets and a few moments to spread that art&nbsp;around as you go along, you will end up with a great, polished&nbsp;game world.</p><h2>References</h2><ul><li>Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine screenshot from <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/review/monaco-whats-yours-is-mine-review/" target="_self">PC Gamer's review</a>.</li><li>Papers Please screenshot from <a href="http://www.dorkadia.com/2013/08/15/papers-please/" target="_self">Dorkadia's review</a>.</li></ul><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21012/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21012/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21012/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21012/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-12T15:47:38.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-12T15:47:38.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

The database for a WordPress Multisite installation will contain extra tables: a set of tables for each site running on the network, and some extra tables for the network itself, as well as the tables for the core site.&nbsp;</p><p>This means there are three elements to understanding how the database works in Multisite:</p><ul><li>Database tables for the core site</li><li>Database tables for the network</li><li>Database tables for each additional site.</li></ul><p>I'll start by looking at how WordPress stores data for the core site.</p><h2>Database Tables for the Core Site in Multisite</h2><p>For the core site in a network, WordPress uses the same 11 database tables as in a single site installation:</p><ul><li><code class="inline">wp_posts</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_postmeta</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_comments</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_commentmeta</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_users</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_usermeta</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_links</code><br></li><li><code class="inline">wp_term_relationships</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_term_taxonomy</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_terms</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_options</code></li></ul><p>These will contain data relating to the main site. Two of them will also contain data relating to the rest of the network. These are:</p><ul><li><code class="inline">wp_users</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_usermeta</code></li></ul><p>The other nine tables work in the same way as they do for a single site - they store data about the main site's content. However those last two tables will also store user data that is relevant to the whole network, as well as user data which is only used by the core site.&nbsp;I will examine this in a moment.</p><h2>Database Tables for the Network</h2><p>As well as storing user data for the whole network in two of the core tables, WordPress also creates additional tables in a Multisite installation which hold data relating to the network and its sites.&nbsp;</p><p>These are:</p><ul><li><code class="inline">wp_blogs</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_blog_versions</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_registration_log</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_signups</code><br></li><li><code class="inline">wp_site</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_sitemeta</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_sitecategories</code> (optional)</li></ul><p>WordPress uses these seven (or six) tables plus the two user tables to store all of the data about the Multisite network. Here's what each of them stores:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table</th><th>Data</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_blogs</code></td><td>This field stores details each site in the network, so it only has one record for each site.</td><td>Fields include <code class="inline">blog_id</code>, <code class="inline">domain</code>, <code class="inline">registered</code> (the data on which the site was created) and <code class="inline">last_updated</code> (again, a date).</td></tr><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_blog_versions</code></td><td>The current database version for each site, updated when you update the network.</td><td>Three fields: <code class="inline">blog_id</code>, <code class="inline">db_version</code> and <code class="inline">last_updated</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_registration_log</code></td><td>The admin user created when each site is registered</td><td>For each site (identified by <code class="inline">blog_id</code>), the table stores the <code class="inline">user_id</code> for the administrator, their email address and the date they registered.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_signups</code></td><td>Stores data on sites which have been signed up for but not activated</td><td>Fields include a unique <code class="inline">signup_id</code> for each record, the domain signed up for, the title, the user login and email address. Once a site is activated this record is deleted and a record is created in <code class="inline">wp_blogs</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_site</code></td><td>Stores the URL for the main site</td><td>This table has only one record with three fields: the id of the main site (which will be <code class="inline">1</code>), its domain and the path (normally <code class="inline">/</code>)</td></tr><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_sitemeta</code></td><td>Stores metadata for the network</td><td>This table is the equivalent of <code class="inline">wp_options</code> for the entire network. It contains all of the metadata relating to the network settings plus smaller amounts of metadata for individual sites. It has four fields: &nbsp;a unique <code class="inline">meta_id</code>, <code class="inline">site_id</code> (which links to <code class="inline">wp_blogs</code>), <code class="inline">meta_key</code> and <code class="inline">meta_value</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_sitecategories</code></td><td>Optional table only created if <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/global_terms" target="_self">global terms</a> are enabled for a site.</td><td>Enabling global terms allows you to use terms across multiple sites in the network. The table (if it is created), will have four fields: <code class="inline">cat_ID</code>, <code class="inline">cat_name</code>, <code class="inline">category_nicename</code> and <code class="inline">last_updated</code>. Note that this tables stores terms, not just categories, despite the field names.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_users</code></td><td>Data on all users is stored here rather than for each site, as individual users can have access to multiple sites on the network.</td><td>In a Multiste installtion WordPress creates two extra fields in the <code class="inline">wp_users</code> table: spam and deleted, both of which are Boolean values defaulting to <code class="inline">NO</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="inline">wp_usermeta</code></td><td>The <code class="inline">wp_usermeta</code> tables stores all metadata for all site users</td><td>The table is used in the same way as for a single site installation.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Relationships Between the Tables</h3><p>Most of these tables are related to the <code class="inline">wp_blogs</code> table via the <code class="inline">blog_ID</code> field, as all of the data needed for the sites in the network will need to be linked to the core site record. The excepts are:</p><ul><li><code class="inline">wp_sitecategories</code>, which links to posts and other content</li><li><code class="inline">wp_signups</code>, as these aren't registered sites yet</li><li><code class="inline">wp_usermeta</code>, which has an indirect link to <code class="inline">wp_blogs</code> via <code class="inline">wp_users</code></li></ul><p>For more detail on each of these tables and their fields, see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description#Multisite_Table_Overview" target="_self">Codex page</a> on the database.</p><h2>Database Tables for Sites in a Network</h2><p>The way in which WordPress stores the data for each of the sites in your network is fairly straightforward: it creates multiple copies of each of the database tables, one for each site. However it doesn't create additional copies of <code class="inline">wp_users</code> and <code class="inline">wp_usermeta</code> as these are all stored in the main table.</p><p>To differentiate between the tables for each site, WordPress adds the site ID to the table name, so for example for site 2, <code class="inline">wp_posts</code> becomes <code class="inline">wp_2_posts</code>.</p><p>Each site will have the following tables:</p><ul><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_posts</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_postmeta</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_comments</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_commentmeta</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_links</code><br></li><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_term_relationships</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_term_taxonomy</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_terms</code></li><li><code class="inline">wp_xx_options</code></li></ul><p>The <code class="inline">xx</code> above will be replaced by the numeric site ID. All of these tables store data in the same way for each site as they would if the site was a single site installation.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>If you're manipulating, retrieving or moving data from a WordPress Multisite installation, it's important to understand the ways in which Multisite stores data differently from a Multisite installation.&nbsp;</p><p>As I've shown, there are three main elements to this: tables used for the core site; tables used to store database about the network as a whole; and tables created for each new site. The structure of these is similar to a single site installation as long as you remember that the two tables storing data on users are not duplicated for each site.</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21214/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21214/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21214/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21214/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-12T14:00:05.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-12T14:00:05.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

Some designers have found great success in communicating with their clients in this way,&nbsp;but how can we leverage style tiles' power in small businesses to make our design process 'leaner'?</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/331/posts/21115/image/image-01.png"></figure><p>If you’ve ever worked in a startup, you know the reality - there aren’t many single well-organized, process-driven, systemized small startups out there. Often, people make stuff up as they go and rare are the founders who really know what they’re doing at all times. But that's the fun of the startup world.</p><p>The reason for this is that setting up rules and systems is a chore. Sure, it might save us time in the future, but we have to make progress now. And so, through a number of iterations and pivots, we end up with a tangled bunch of procedures.</p><p>This approach oftentimes creeps into the design process as well. We build an&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_self">MVP</a> in one weekend. And then, we don’t really have the time to re-design everything (customers are waiting!) so we build off of that. And in the end we have same-action buttons in our app that look different, or inconsistent typography in the newsletters.</p><p>Maybe, we need to pivot on our design process in startups. Delivering hi-fidelity mockups without any prior discussion often turns out to be a complete waste of time - after receiving feedback from the team, the entire process resets to zero. I recommend more of us start implementing the <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/style-tiles-an-alternative-to-full-design-comps--webdesign-7232" target="_self">style tiles approach</a>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/30/posts/21115/image/style_tiles_intro.jpg"></figure><h2>Benefits of Style Tiles for Startups</h2><blockquote>Lean - a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination.</blockquote><p>Going along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing" target="_self">Wikipedia's definition of Lean</a>, style tiles reasonably form a part of ‘lean design’. Their use is aimed at better expenditure of resources, like time and money:</p><h3>Style Tiles Save Time</h3><p>It might seem counter-intuitive to add an action into a process that should be shortened, but we are in fact shortening it. Style tiles provide a way to facilitate getting feedback from clients. Replace the word ‘clients’ with ‘the team’ and you have the perfect solution for startups. Even for <a href="http://www.thesolopreneurlife.com/" target="_self">solopreneurs</a>, style tiles make discussions about style direction and asking for customer feedback so much easier.</p><h3>Style Tiles&nbsp;Save Money</h3><p>This applies especially for bootstrappers, where it’s crucial to be extra-cautious about finances as self-funded businesses possess a very limited budget. And for non-designer entrepreneurs, paying for a designer <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-web-designers-guide-to-pricing--webdesign-2969">can be one of the largest </a>expenses. Especially when paying on per-hour basis, it's much cheaper to get a high-quality designer to develop style tiles which then a junior or executive designer turns into final designs.</p><h2>Implementing Style Tiles Into the Workflow</h2><p>Now that we've established just how beneficial style tiles can be in Startups' workflows, let's peek into how we can apply them.</p><p>These are the stages when style tiles can come in handy:</p><ul><li>Developing a minimum viable product.</li><li>Asking for customer feedback.</li><li>Product/brand expansion.</li></ul><h3>Developing a Minimum Viable Product</h3><p>Style tiles will speed up the MVP creation process as they separates style from layout. They can also come in handy when design is based on non-custom assets.</p><p>A real-life example of this could be a well-known occurrence of newly-founded startups grabbing an HTML/CMS template from the web, furnishing it with their logo, and trying to 'sort-of' get the colors right. Solid pre-developed style tiles will help &nbsp;ensure that customized web templates look consistent with the rest of the branding.</p><h3>Asking for Customer Feedback</h3><p>The importance of getting early customer feedback is oftentimes discussed; but not so much when it comes to branding. Just like product, its design should be tailored to our target audience as well - so why not just ask them? Of course, it's not a particularly great idea to seek approval of each button, but performing a basic testing of a couple of versions can help you make better design decisions.</p><p>Just as you would for a freelance client, create two or three style tiles and have your customers (either social media followers or even random people on the street fitting into your target audience) decide between them.</p><h3>Product or Brand Expansion</h3><p>Style tiles are the ‘startup version’ of brand guidelines.</p><p>In the first stages of a fresh new business, time and money can oftentimes be better spent on style tiles than on an extensive brand guides. They are much more flexible, and allow changes in the future - for example when your business enters the Fortune 500.</p><p>Have your style tiles feature all the generic design elements - from typography, colours, to copywriting rules - develop a well-organised moodboard for your startup that sets rules for all communication of your company.</p><h3>Lean Design vs. Classic Design</h3><p>In the classic approach, the designer(s) in the team would discuss the goals and purposes of the product. Then, they would sketch up some wireframes, present those to the team, gather feedback, and dive into mockups. After numerous iterations of the hi-fidelity mockups, the PSDs get shipped to developers.</p><p>Lean design takes a couple of shortcuts. After getting wireframes approved by the rest of the team, they will create style tiles. Making changes to these is a lot quicker than on finished mockups, which saves at least as much time as introducing this additional step into the process. After getting a <i>yes</i> on style tiles, they can produce the final mockups by just following the guidelines set in the tiles. With enough manpower, it is even possible to prepare elements from style tiles in CSS before even finishing the final mockups.</p><p>Hey, work smarter, not harder, right?</p><h2>Problems With the Lean Design Approach</h2><p>The main problem with style tiles that I, as well as a number of other designers had faced, is its vagueness. Some clients simply need a concrete representation of their website or app and aren’t able to look through the simplicity of style tiles.</p><p>In small teams this issue fortunately rarely comes up if made up of tech or design professionals. In some cases though, especially when co-founding with some non-design folks, it would still make sense to take the tried-and-tested design approach of hi-fidelity mockups.</p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>It’s your call. Your team and business will definitely benefit from shortening time, required for shipping a new product, not to mention implementing a better way of working as a team. Test-drive this process in your own company and see if it works for you!</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21115/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21115/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21115/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21115/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-12T12:55:19.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-12T12:55:19.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

In a lot of ways, that’s true. There’s no native way to use most iCloud features on Windows, the filesystems often conflict in services like Dropbox due to a difference in naming—what’s hidden and what isn’t—and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all this, Apple still built OS X with a function that allows file sharing with Windows. It’s hidden in <b>System Preferences</b>, though, and most people don’t know how to use it. In this tutorial, I’ll show you the basics of sharing files with Windows using OS X’s native solution, as well as a few alternatives.</p>

<h2>How File Sharing Works</h2>

<p>Every computer has the ability to share files with another machine over a network, whether it’s a <i>local area network</i>&nbsp;(LAN) or <i>wireless local area network </i>(WLAN). The devices use the router as a connection point to transmit files to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>The term <i>file sharing</i> makes this technology sound limited—you can actually share entire folders with people on the same network as you. iTunes uses this technology to share your media library with other people on your network.</p>

<p>File sharing can often be a faster way to keep computers on your network updated with the latest files for a project. People usually use it with one platform or the other, not Mac-to-Windows or vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>It can,&nbsp;however,&nbsp;be a better way to collaborate in the office or give files to a friend without a USB drive or any external hardware aside from a network. If you don’t have a network or the Windows machine you’re using doesn’t have Wi-Fi, you can always use a direct Ethernet cable instead.</p>

<h2>Users and File Sharing</h2>

<p>Before you proceed, it’s important that you know administrator accounts have access to the entire Macintosh HD.&nbsp;</p><p>On the Windows side, you’ll be prompted to log in to an account on the Mac for file sharing. If you use your administrator account, it will have access to everything on your computer. If you’d like to restrict the access, you can do so by adding a new user account and giving it access to those files. The Windows machine will then use its credentials and be sandboxed to those specific files and folders.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21318/image/Screen Shot 2014-06-02 at 5.25.25 PM.png"><figcaption>Adding a user account may be necessary if you need to keep some things private.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Another important note about administrator accounts in file sharing: they have read and write access. If you don’t want the Windows machine to have the ability to add, remove, or modify something on your Mac, ensure that you use an extra user account.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Native File Sharing With Windows</h2>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21318/image/Screen Shot 2014-06-02 at 4.46.06 PM.png"><figcaption>Checking the&nbsp;<b>On&nbsp;</b>box beside your user will enable Windows file haring.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Configuring Windows file sharing is a pretty straightforward process and only takes about five minutes. Below is a step-by-step guide to getting started.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure you’re connected to the same network as the other computer(s).</li>
<li>Launch <strong>System Preferences</strong>, select the <strong>Sharing</strong> pane, and <b>unlock</b> it if need be.</li>
<li>Select <strong>File Sharing</strong> from the sidebar, but don’t check the box beside it just yet.</li>
<li>If you chose to use the user-based file sharing method, you’ll need to set which folders to share. Under the <strong>Shared Folders</strong> menu, add a folder you would like to share by clicking <strong>+</strong>, locating it in the file browser, and double-clicking it. There may be a delay when clicking <strong>+</strong> while the system loads settings. By default, your user’s <strong>Public</strong> folder will be the only thing shared. You can copy items into it to share them.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<b>Options&nbsp;</b>and check the&nbsp;<b>On</b> box beside your user in the&nbsp;<b>Windows File Sharing</b> box.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>On</strong> box beside <strong>File Sharing</strong> in the left pane to switch it on.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Accessing the Files from Windows</h2>



<p>Once you’ve set up file sharing on the Mac, accessing it is the second part of the challenge. Once again, I’ve compiled a quick step-by-step guide to make sure you can access the files.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/77/posts/21318/image/Windows File Sharing.PNG"><figcaption>The whole process is pretty quick.</figcaption></figure>

<ol>
<li>Launch <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> and click <strong>Network</strong> in the left pane. You may be asked to enable network visibility. You need to do this in order to access the files on your Mac.</li>
<li>Find the Mac. It may be named something different than it is in <strong>System Preferences</strong>. For example, my computer’s local network name is <em>FluffyMittenBook</em>, but it appeared as <em>MACBOOKPRO–14D8</em> on the Windows machine. You’ll find the machine under the <strong>Computer</strong> section of the <strong>Explorer</strong> window.</li>
<li>Double-click the icon for the Mac. You’ll be asked for a <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>. These credentials will be the same as the ones associated with the user account from which you are sharing the files. To check the <b>username</b>, head to <strong>Finder</strong> and look at the name beside your home folder. Be sure to use the exact same name—it’s case-sensitive.</li>
<li>Upon successful authentication, the Windows computer will be granted access to the folders that you have shared on the network. If you logged in with an administrator account, you’ll see its public folder, home folder, and the Macintosh HD, along with any other folders you shared.</li>
<li>To test the connection with your Mac, try transferring a file from it to the desktop. If you have administrator access to the Mac in <b>File sharing</b>, you can also try transferring something to the Mac. These should be relatively fast, but it all depends on the speed of the router and computer WiFi cards.</li>
</ol>

<h2>OS X File Sharing Alternatives</h2>

<p>It’s important to mention the other options available to Mac and Windows users. I’ve compiled a short list of the two best tools for the job below, along with a short description of why they’re useful. You may have your own preference, which you’re free to mention in the comments.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com"><strong>Dropbox</strong></a>. I use this cloud-based service for everything from photo backups to large file sharing. Most people don’t know that it has local network sync as well, so you can transfer large files from one computer to another quickly if they’re near each other.</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com"><strong>Google Drive.</strong></a> This service is similar to Dropbox, but has more space for free and is powered by Google’s absurdly-vast array of servers. It has native apps available for both Mac and Windows, but unlike Dropbox it does not offer local network sync.</li>
</ul>

We’re going to gradually create 10 Layers throughout this tutorial. This allows us to create a poster with more depth, and apply effects easily to individual elements of the design. Firstly, we’ll introduce a vintage-look papery background to the poster.</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Open the <b>Layers</b> panel if not already open (<b>Window &gt; Layers</b>).&nbsp;</p><p>Click on the <b>Create New Layer</b> icon at the bottom right of the <b>Layers</b> panel. <b>Double-click</b> the default ‘<i>Layer 1</i>’ name and rename this Layer ‘<i>Paper Background</i>’.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/2_Step1.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Introduce a new frame using the <b>Rectangle Frame Tool (F)</b> and extend the edges to the edge of the Bleed.

Click <b>Open</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Use the <b>Fill Frame Proportionally</b> icon in the top control panel to arrange the image, making sure none of the edges of the paper are visible on the document.

Here, I’ve been lucky enough to be able to use&nbsp;<a href="http://tutorials.tutsplus.com/authors/sergey-kandakov" rel="external" target="_blank">Sergey Kandakov</a>’s really cool, retro-style illustration of a <a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-retro-footballer-in-adobe-illustrator-for-the-world-cup--cms-20827" target="_self">soccer player</a>.</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p><b>Lock</b> the <i>Circle</i> Layer in the <b>Layers</b>&nbsp;panel and create a <b>New Layer</b>. Name this <i>Soccer Player</i>.</p><p>Introduce a new frame using the <b>Rectangle Frame Tool (F) </b>about <b>430 mm</b> in <b>Height </b>and <b>175 mm</b> in <b>Width</b>. Go to <b>Edit &gt; Place</b>. Select an <b>EPS </b>file with a transparent background, like Sergey’s vector here. <b>Click Open</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Use the <b>Fill Frame Proportionally</b> icon in the top control panel to fit your image snugly in the frame. To give a sense of movement, extend the bottom of the image over the bottom of the white frame and allow the top of the image to just reach over the top white frame as well.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/5_Step1.jpg"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">6.</span> Use Exciting Typography to Communicate Your Message</h2><p>We’ll use the soccer player image as a rough frame to position text around. We’ll have two sorts of text - firstly, the <b>headline</b>, and secondly, the <b>details</b>. Let’s create a striking headline first.</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Firstly, we need to select a suitable headline font. I’ve gone for <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/DayPosterBlack" rel="external" target="_blank">DayPosterBlack</a>&nbsp;- it’s great in All Caps, and has a slightly Retro, even Art Deco, feel.</p><p>In the <b>Layers </b>panel, <b>Lock</b> the <i>Soccer Player</i> Layer and create a <b>New Layer</b>. Rename this as <i>Text</i>.</p><p>Type ‘<i>WORLD CUP 2014</i>’ and set the<b> Font</b> to <b>DayPosterBlack</b> <b>Regular</b>, <b>Size</b> to <b>81 pt </b>and set the text to <b>Align Center </b>from the <b>Character Formatting Controls</b>&nbsp;panel at the top of your screen. Insert a couple of <b>spaces</b> between ‘<i>CUP</i>’ and ‘<i>2014</i>’ to fit the soccer ball in between (or increase the <b>Kerning</b> value).</p><p>With the text frame selected, hover the <b>Eyedropper Tool (I)</b> over the dark navy of the soccer player’s shorts and <b>Clic</b><b>k Once</b>. The Tool may pick this up as an <b>RGB Swatch</b>. You can <b>double-click</b> the Swatch square in the <b>Tools Panel </b>to open the <b>Color Picker Window</b>. Click in the <b>C, M, Y,</b> or <b>K</b> value box to allow you to click <b>Add CMYK Swatch</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the <b>Swatches</b> panel (<b>Window &gt; Swatches</b>) rename this as Poster Navy.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/6_Step1.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>We ideally want to stretch the text to give it a more retro look. If you look at vintage posters, often the margins are very narrow, and text is stretched or manipulated to fill empty space.</p><p>With the text frame selected go to <b>Type &gt; Create Outlines</b>. Your text has now been converted to a group of shapes.</p><p>Use the <b>Selection Tool (V, Escape) </b>and drag the bottom of the frame to stretch the text vertically. Pull it down until you have a very narrow gap between the bottom of the white frame and the text. Allow a little more space above the text to give an authentic retro feel to the headline.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/6_Step2.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Go to the <b>Layers</b>&nbsp;panel and click and drag the <i>Text</i> Layer to sit beneath the <i>Soccer Player </i>Layer, and above the&nbsp;<i>Circle</i> Layer.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/6_Step3.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>Introduce a new text frame on the same <i>Text</i> Layer <b>117 mm</b> in <b>Height</b> and <b>162 mm</b> in <b>Width</b>. Position this in the lower left corner of the poster.</p><p>We want to introduce a second font here. It needs to have a retro look, but also look suited to the Brazilian setting of the tournament and have a less formal feel than the headline. I’ve gone for <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bahiana" rel="external" target="_blank">Bahiana</a>, which is really fun.</p><p>Type ‘<i>RIO </i>(paragraph break) <i>BRAZIL</i>’ in <b>All Caps</b> and set the <b>Font </b>to <b>Bahiana Regular</b>. Highlight ‘<i>RIO</i>’ alone and set the <b>Size</b> to <b>400 pt</b> and the <b>Font Color</b> to <i>Circle Yellow</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Highlight ‘<i>BRAZIL</i>’ alone and set the <b>Size</b> to <b>186 pt </b>and the <b>Leading</b> to <b>150 pt</b>. Introduce a <b>New CMYK Swatch</b> in the <b>Swatches</b>&nbsp;panel with values <b>C=84, M=15, Y=100, K=2</b> and rename this <i>Poster Green</i>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/6_Step4.jpg"></figure><p>Move the text frame to the left using the <b>Selection Tool (V, Escape)</b> so that the text rests exactly on the margin. You may need to <b>decrease</b> the <b>Tracking</b> before ‘<i>BRAZIL</i>’ to allow the two lines of text to line up precisely.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/6_Step4_1.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3><p>You can now add in more text details, such as a time, place and/or date for your event. Here, I’ve just inserted the names of a couple of cities where the games will be hosted.&nbsp;</p><p>Here I introduced another text frame using the <b>Type Tool (T)</b> and positioned this above the ‘<i>RIO/BRAZIL</i>’ frame. I varied the <b>Font Size</b> and <b>Leading</b> of the text to wrap around the Yellow Circle, while maintaining a tight, unified look to the block of text.&nbsp;</p><p>I also introduced <i>[Paper]</i> as a neutral Swatch that works well with the <i>Circle Yellow</i> and <i>Poster Green</i> Swatches.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/6_Step5.jpg"></figure><p><b>Your poster’s looking really super and the main layout is now in place. </b>We can add just a little finishing touch to give it that extra depth and an authentic retro feel.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/114/posts/20936/image/6_Step5_1.jpg"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">7.</span> Give Your Poster Background a Sense of Movement</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Create a <b>New Layer</b> in the <b>Layers</b>&nbsp;panel and rename it <i>Stripes - Inner</i>.

The 2014 World Cup in Brazil starts today! In this tutorial, I decided to create a bright illustration with a retro style effect but with a nod to the hosting teams colors, all in Adobe Illustrator.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">1.</span> Prepare Your Workspace</h2><p>You will need: Adobe Illustrator, a <a href="http://photodune.net/item/soccer-player-playing-with-football/5447535?ref=VectorPremium" target="_self">stock photo of a footballer</a>&nbsp;and a graphics tablet.</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Lets create a&nbsp;<b>New Document</b> in <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> with following settings.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/1_Step_1.png"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>You need some picture of footballer to be used as derivative. I found amazing image on <a href="http://photodune.net/item/soccer-player-playing-with-football/5447535?ref=VectorPremium" target="_self">Photodune</a>.&nbsp;There are a&nbsp;lot of photos with football players available, however I picked this one because it has&nbsp;nice lighting and a good dynamic pose.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/Steven_0615.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Drag and drop your picture on the current layer. Open the&nbsp;<b>Layer Settings</b> by clicking&nbsp;double&nbsp;on this layer.&nbsp;Rename it as <b>Picture</b>&nbsp;and use the following settings.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/1_Step_3.png"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>Let's create and&nbsp;add some retro colors in the&nbsp;<b>Swatches</b> panel. The colors have to be strong, contrasting and bright. Go to the&nbsp;<b>Color </b>panel and play with the&nbsp;<b>RGB</b> settings.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/1_Step_4_1.png"></figure><p>I'll be using a deep blue retro color. Nice for shadows and contours.&nbsp;Lets create and add a few more colors. These are the codes for the colors I'll be using:&nbsp;<code class="inline">#FFFFFF</code>, <code class="inline">#AB673D</code>,&nbsp;<code class="inline">#AB673D</code>, <code class="inline">#FFD438</code>, <code class="inline">#179840</code>, <code class="inline">#66999C</code>. You can use them or create your own.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">2.</span>&nbsp;Create the Main Shapes</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Create a&nbsp;<b>New Layer</b> above the stock image layer. Choose the dark blue color as <b>Fill</b> color. Lets create the main contour shape with <b>Pen Tool (P)</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_1.png"></figure><p>Pay attention to details. But don't make the shape too smooth. Sharp angles give a good old school&nbsp;effect.&nbsp;</p><p>Use&nbsp;<b>Preview&nbsp;</b>mode (<b>View &gt; Preview</b>) to see outlines only. Its great way to make this process much easier.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_1_1.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>When you have finished with the main shape select it and create one more contour by going to&nbsp;<b>Object &gt; Path &gt;&nbsp;Offset Path.&nbsp;</b>Lock the generated path (<b>Object &gt; Lock &gt; Selection</b>).</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_2.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Let's divide the original shape into several basic&nbsp;parts: head, hands, feet and clothes. Still using the&nbsp;<b>Pen Tool (P)</b> create a new shape of the face above the main shape.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_3.jpg"></figure><p>Create the hands, legs and clothes elements the same way.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually it's not required for the shapes to be closed. You can just make some contour lines in the areas where the main shape will be divided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_3_1.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>After that, select all shapes (except offset and locked one of course)&nbsp;and click the&nbsp;<b>Divide </b>button in the&nbsp;<b>Pathfinder</b> panel.&nbsp;Then <b>Ungroup</b>&nbsp;(<b>Object &gt; Ungroup</b>)&nbsp;this all and remove any unnecessary stay objects.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_4.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3><p>Select each piece and change the <b>Fill</b> color using the swatches you created before.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_5.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 6</h3><p>Add more deep blue&nbsp;contours in the places which needs strong contrast.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_6.jpg"></figure><p><b>Offset Path</b> of each piece&nbsp;again (just like you have done before&nbsp;in <b>Step&nbsp;2</b>) to get fast extra&nbsp;contour shapes. Use the&nbsp;<b>Pen Tool (P)</b><b>&nbsp;</b>to create some lines on the hands and finger areas.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_6_1.png"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_6_2.jpg"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/2_Step_6_3.jpg"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">3.</span>&nbsp;Add the Details</h2><p>This part of work is most laborious. But at the same time it's the most fun and interesting.</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Starting from the top let's create face details using the&nbsp;<b>Pen Tool (P)</b>. The&nbsp;<b>Fill</b> color is still deep blue. I decided to drop down the opacity level in <b>Picture </b>layer options to have better <b>Preview</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_1.jpg"></figure><p>Continue to add details around the face.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_1_1.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Choose the yellow color for the fill and create the midtones areas. Don't forget to&nbsp;switch <b>Preview </b>mode all the time to see where you have to put this yellow color.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_1_2.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Create a&nbsp;<b>Calligraphic Brush</b>&nbsp;for stylish artistic lines to make your artwork more detailed. Click the&nbsp;<b>New Brush</b> button in the&nbsp;<b>Brushes</b> panel and&nbsp;use the following settings.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_3.jpg"></figure><p>Continue drawing using your graphics tablet. Experiment with pressure: some lines have to be thin, some lines need to be thick. If sometime you feel the need to use the&nbsp;<b>Pen Tool</b> - feel free to use it. As you can see on picture below I was using the&nbsp;<b>Pen Tool</b> for the larger areas, and <b>Brush</b> - for the line shaped thin areas.&nbsp;</p><p>This is important part of work when you realizing how exactly your whole image looks like. The style your details have to be kept&nbsp;&nbsp;through the whole work process.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_2.jpg"></figure><p>If you're not happy with&nbsp;your <b>Brush</b> drawing results try to change this settings (press <b>Enter</b>). I was using these:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_1_3.jpg"></figure><p>Also check out your <b>Graphics Tablet</b> settings. I have got <b>Pressure Intensity</b> set up on the hardest level to have the best pressure control.</p><h3>Step 4</h3><p>Add contour lights on hair with a brown color and some highlights on face using white. Continue going down and add shadows on t-shirt. Again use the&nbsp;<b>Pen Tool</b> for big solid areas and <b>Brush</b> for more detailed thin lines.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_4.jpg"></figure><p>Add highlights as well.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_4_2.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3><p>There is a&nbsp;great way to make your shadows and highlights areas more detailed and stylish. Add sharp&nbsp;contiguous&nbsp;lines here and there just like I've done on pictures below.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_5 copy.jpg"></figure><p>Look how I created the yellow midtones and white highlights on the hands. Do it same way: somewhere with <b>Pen Tool</b> and somewhere with <b>Brush.</b></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_5_1.jpg"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_5_2.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 6</h3><p>Pay attention to contour lights - thin lines on the sides. These lines gives great contrast. Create them using the <b>Paintbrush Tool (B)</b>.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_6_1.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 7</h3><p>Continue going down with details. Add green midtones and white highlights on the shorts.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_6.jpg"></figure><p>Add a number on the shorts too. Distort it with the&nbsp;<b>Warp Tool</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Direct Selection Tool (A)</b>.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_7.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 8</h3><p>Still using the <b>Paintbrush Tool</b> add some decorative thin lines and&nbsp;little dots here and there to make illustration be more textured.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_8.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 9</h3><p>Draw some lines on the gaiters and move to the shoes.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_9.jpg"></figure><p>I was drawing blind because the shoes in derivative picture are black. Its almost solid black: poor midtones and&nbsp;highlights. That means sometimes you have to be extra creative and run with your imagination.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_9_1.jpg"></figure><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_9_2.jpg"></figure><h3>Step 10</h3><p>Add the finishing touches: contrast lines, decorative&nbsp;dots, little scribbles.&nbsp;&nbsp;I add more curls to the hair, some wet drops on the face, few extra lines to the mustache and barb.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/136/posts/20827/image/3_Step_10.jpg"></figure><p>And finally we got cool bright&nbsp;retro styled footballer!

Many attempts have been made, and new libraries are produced every year it seems. However, even after decades of R&amp;D, there is still nothing that comes really close to capturing the <i>feel</i> of a live string section.<br></p><p>This tutorial will deal with enhancements you can make to your string writing no matter what library you use. It is possible to make good libraries sound bad, and bad libraries sound good. Obviously here at Tuts+, it's better to focus on the latter.</p><p>We will address each topic of improvement by starting with a simple, short piece of string music, and going through it stage by stage to make it sound better than it was originally.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the first rendition:</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-basic.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>This track currently has:<br></p><ul><li>No round-robin sampling</li><li>No velocity changes in either the short strings</li><li>No layering</li><li>No rever</li><li>No EQ</li><li>No real performance of the piece (a lack of expression and phrasing).</li></ul><p>This is not something you ever want to have in your music if you are trying to replicate a live orchestra, but there are some sample libraries which limit your choices in how things sound (no round-robin). The first thing you can do though, is add velocity changes.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">Tip 1.</span> Velocities</h2><p>This is one of the most common problems when hearing tracks that are produced with samples, especially in 'epic' tracks. A lot of composers who are starting out like to hammer the keys at the highest velocity to make it 'epic'. Unfortunately, music doesn't work so well like this.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes things feel 'epic' are builds and sells in the music, and to do that requires a degree of performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the cheapest libraries have articulations recorded at multiple velocities, so it’s best to make use of them.&nbsp;</p><p>If the softer velocities are not loud enough than use the volume controls to compensate. If you're triggering the hard velocities for short notes the whole time, it just sounds static and repetitive. This is the opposite of what a string section is.<br></p><p>Here's what that sounds like.</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-novelocity.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>And here's what it sounds like with velocity changes.</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-withvelocity.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>It's an improvement, but still a long way to go.</p><p>To illustrate how important velocities are, here is a different short piece just using an ascending scale. The first version is without velocity changing (everything playing at the highest velocity) and the second version is with velocity changing.</p><p><b>Without velocity changing (warning, loud!):</b></p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-scale-without-velocity.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>With velocity changing:</b><br></p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-scale-with-velocity.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/image/strings-mockups-velocities-1.JPG"><figcaption>Velocity illustration</figcaption></figure><p>The bottom part shows red bars on a scale of 0-127. In the 'without velocity' version, I set all of these to 127, and it does not sound good. Obviously, this is an exaggeration to illustrate a point, but it goes without saying that there should always be variation in velocity in your string parts (and other orchestral parts), as this is more natural.</p><p>This little scale utilized round-robin sampling. Next, I'll explain why this is important.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">Tip 2.</span> Round-Robin Sampling</h2><p>What is round-robin sampling? Simply put, it's a method that sample developers use so that when you hit the same note on your keyboard—e.g.&nbsp;a 'D'—and then play it again, a different recording of that same note plays.&nbsp;</p><p>So instead of your playback being:</p><p><b>&nbsp;'D Sample 1 - D Sample 1 - D Sample 1'</b>, it becomes&nbsp;</p><p><b>'D Sample 1 - D Sample 2 - D Sample 3</b>&nbsp;- <b>D Sample 1 - D Sample 2 - D Sample 3</b>'</p><p>In this day and age, almost every string library utilizes round-robin sampling, and by default is turned on. Here are the short strings from that opening piece with and without round-robin sampling (but with velocity changes).</p><h4>Without round-robin sampling:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-no-RR.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>With round-robin sampling:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-with-RR.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>The round-robin adds subtle variation on the samples that gives them more life.<br></p><h3>I Don't Have Round-Robin Samples!</h3><p>If you don't have round-robin samples for some reason (you will be able to tell this because you'll get the machine-gun effect as heard in 'Without round-robin sampling' above), then there are twp things you can do to help yourself.</p><p>First, <i>write parts that avoid repetition</i>. It's repetition that is causing your samples to sound machine-gun like. Add space into your parts. You still have the velocity changes so that's what's going to help you add variety to your parts. Here's what that might sound like.</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-no-RR-space.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>Secondly, if you're still missing the 'busyness' of the original, then you can <i>do some layering with additional instruments to fill out the parts</i>. Use other instruments that have a staccato feel, such as pizzicato strings, or piano, or harp, even percussion will help. Here are a couple of ideas.</p><h4><b>With additional pizzicato strings following the harmony:</b></h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-no-RR-pizz.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>With pizzicato strings, piano, and timpani following the harmony:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-no-RR-layered.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>Both of these still use the original strings with <i>no</i> round-robin, but the round-robin has been disguised now by the other instruments. It might not sound exactly the same as the original in terms of the notes on the page, however, it has a better 'feel'.&nbsp;</p><p>The key to writing convincing orchestral sample mockups is <i>feel</i>. It doesn't matter how good your library is if it can't convey a certain emotion, so you need to do whatever you can to improve the feel. In the vast majority of cases, composers are not going to be able to utilize a live orchestra for their track (or even a single live player) so you need to write <i>for</i><b>&nbsp;</b>the samples and <i>work within their limitations.</i></p><p>The above two tracks featured a technique called <i>layering,</i> which we will cover later in the guide. But now we will proceed to cover the 'long' string sound that plays over these short notes, and how we can improve the sound of them.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">Tip 3.</span> Expression Controls</h2><p>In the original version of the track we had a sustained string line over the top of the short strings. Now that we've added round-robin and velocity to the short strings let's see what it sounds like.</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-sustain-no-EXP.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>It's not bad, but it could be a lot better. The problem is that it is played statically, with no expression. String players do not play like this in real life, which is something you'll have to try to emulate.</p><p>Many sample libraries come with a dynamic controller that crossfade between dynamics. The library I am using for this track (Symphobia) has such a controller.&nbsp;</p><p>It's worth pointing out at this stage, that while Symphobia is still one of the most expensive libraries on the market, it is still possible—as demonstrated so far—to make it sound pretty bad. I hope this reinforces one of my overall points that is <i>it's not what sample library you have, it's how you use it.</i></p><p>If your sample library does not have a patch that dynamically crossfades, you can still use volume control in Kontakt or your sampler of choice to add more of a performance to it. In Kontakt, you can right click on the volume control and do a 'Learn Midi CC'. Then twiddle any knob/fader/controller on your keyboard, and Kontakt will respond to it when you play.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/image/strings-mockups-expression.JPG"></figure><p>Now let's hear that string part with some Modwheel control added to it. The Modwheel in Symphobia will crossfade between different dynamic samples. This will add a degree of performance to the track, and should bring it to life. Here's what that sounds like:</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-with-DXF-MW.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>And here's what that looks like:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/image/strings-mockups-modwheel.JPG"></figure><p>You can see the bottom the data for CC1 (Modwheel). It is constantly moving, and particularly on the longer notes is where the line benefits. Long notes are not static when they are performed, and thus your sampled strings should not be static either.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Your sequences for orchestral work should be covered with all kinds of expression data,</i> either via the modwheel, or volume control, or both. It will add a lot to your track, especially for long sustained lines. Here are a couple more examples.</p><h4>Without expression data:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-chord-no-exp.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>With expression data:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-chord-with-exp.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>If you start doing this with your string lines, you are adding a performance quality to your work, and this is what creates feeling in music. No matter how brilliant the notes on the page, if they are not performed well, they will not shine.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">Tip 4.</span> Layering</h2><p>Layering is a huge topic that is probably worthy of its own tutorial, as it not only deals with how to work with samples, but also arrangement and orchestration. However, I will try to introduce it here and show how in many ways you can use layering to improve your existing sound.</p><p>A very common problem in mockups is where the samples themselves are exposed. That is, one sample library—that might not be of the best quality—playing alone with no other instruments to support it. In the real world, a string section playing by itself would work fine, but in the sampled world, if your samples are not of the highest quality, the performance and feel falls apart. There are numerous layering methods that can fix this:</p><ol><li>Combining different string sample libraries to play the notes.</li><li>Using different mic positions in your existing string libraries (if available).</li><li>Accentuating with a different string sample library certain notes that the original sample library is playing.</li><li>Accentuating with a different string articulation certain notes that the original sample library is playing.</li><li>Using orchestration techniques to add different instruments to the track that support the original string samples (as heard earlier in the <i>I Don't Have Round-Robin</i> section).</li><li>As per George Strezov's excellent Tuts+ <a href="http://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/making-your-midi-strings-even-more-realistic--audio-11503" rel="external" target="_blank">tutorial</a>, add one live player to your existing track.&nbsp;</li></ol><h3>1. Combining Different String Sample Libraries</h3><p>A common technique used by numerous composers, is to blend certain sample libraries together. Something I like to do is take a smaller section, either a solo string sound or a smaller string sound (a divisi recording) to add some bite. However, most sample libraries are recorded in different venues, so whatever you choose will add something different.</p><h4>With additional spiccato strings:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-layering-lass.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>With additional spiccato strings + sustains:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-layering-lass-adagio.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>With additional spiccato strings + sustains + violin solo:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-layering-lass-adagio-solo.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>When used carefully, layering and blending different sample libraries together can create a powerful effect. It's a personal recommendation that whatever you do add, the string section should be smaller in size. This will give you a level of intimacy that your 'bigger' string sound can't provide. In the manuals of most sample libraries you can find out the size of the string section that was recorded and this will help inform your decision.</p><h3>2. Trying Different Microphone Positions</h3><p>If you do not have the funds for acquiring many different sample libraries, then look within your own. Many libraries nowadays come with multiple mic positions, and they can often give you a quite different sound. A couple of very short examples:</p><h4>Close Mic:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-close-mic.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>Room Mic:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-room-mic.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>The above are taken from the same sample library, but one uses only the close microphone samples, and the other uses the room microphone samples.</p><p>Close microphone samples generally add bite, detail and presence. Room microphones (depending on where the library was recorded) are what give you the ambience and 'feel'. In the big Hollywood soundtracks, the biggest component that gives them that feel is the room they were recorded in.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, you want a balance between close and stage mics, depending on your project and your taste. <i>Generally a good starting point is a ratio of 66% stage, 33% close,</i> but you can always dial in the close mic further for more intimacy or something that's more up front or in your face.</p><h3>3. Accentuating Certain Notes with a Different Sample Library</h3><p>A common trick I like to do, particularly for bass and to accentuate harmonic movement, is to accentuate parts that I want to emphasize. When you do this with a different library, you'll add a new tonal quality to your strings. This also makes for a more interesting listening experience.&nbsp;</p><p>With the original track, with none of the layering from Part 1 of this section, here's what just adding a very simple bass line does when it accentuates certain notes.</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-layering-accentuate.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>This particular library has real bite, so there is a strong attack on the notes that the original sample library (Symphobia) wasn't providing. Note that they are not playing everything that the Symphobia part was, just certain notes in the bass.</p><p>Another quick example with violins. The first one just has a violin section. The second has the same violin section but with a solo violin accentuating certain notes. It gives it a subtle andd ifferent feel, but also adds a touch of sonic interest. Both sound good, but if you have a part that does this ostinato for a long time, you need to look for ways to continue to make it interesting. (This is something that Hans Zimmer does particularly well.)</p><h4>Regular:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-short-nolayer.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>With Accentuated Layer:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-short-layered2.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h3>4. Accentuating Certain Notes with a Different Articulation</h3><p>We already have touched on this back in the <i>I Don't Have Round-Robin</i> section. Using a different articulation from the string section, you can add more sonic interest. A classic combo that has been a staple of orchestration for centuries is to double a staccato cello line with a pizzicato bass.</p><h4>Cellos Only:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-shorts-only.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>Cellos With Pizz.:</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-shorts-pizz.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>We can then apply this technique to the original track. It's less noticeable with everything else around it, but if you apply lots of these small techniques, things gradually improve.</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-pizz-layer.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h3>5. Using Different Orchestration Techniques To Enhance Existing Harmony</h3><p>Again, we already touched on this in the <i>I Don't Have Round-Robin</i> section. This technique requires a knowledge of orchestration and knowing what instruments blend will with each other. This is a lifetime's study, and far too much to cover here, but there are things you can do that are common sense when layering.</p><ul><li>Short samples pair well with other short samples.</li><li>Long samples pair well with other long samples.</li><li>A bass instrument from one section will likely (but not always) pair well with a bass instrument from another section. e.g. bassoon and cello/bass.</li><li>A high instrument from one section will likely (but not always) pair well with a high instrument from another section, e.g. violin and flute.</li><li>Percussion, when used sparsely, layers well with everything. The percussion section is a very easy way to add a tiny bit of sonic interest to your parts. You should not overdo it, but if ever you feel something has become too static, a little percussion can go a long way.</li><li><i>Use your good samples to help out your bad ones!</i></li></ul><p>There are plenty of orchestration books that can help you with good sound combos, but an underrated online resource is the <a href="http://www.vsl.co.at/en/70/149/150/46.vsl" rel="external" target="_blank">VSL Academy</a> which also has for every instrument, sound combination <a href="http://www.vsl.co.at/en/70/3189/3190/5626.vsl" target="_self">examples.</a> These apply not just to live orchestra, but also for samples.</p><p>Additionally, you can buy film scores from <a href="http://www.alexanderpublishing.com/Departments/Film-Scoring-and-More.aspx" rel="external" target="_blank">Alexander Publishing </a>and study them. You would be amazed at how much doubling happens in a film score. All of these instrument combinations are used by the pros, and you should use them too. The resources are available for you. Use them!</p><p>Here is a simple example, just using two chords of how simple orchestration can enhance an existing piece while retaining the same feel.&nbsp;</p><h4>2 String Chords + Harp</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-orch-1.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>2 String Chords + Harp + Solo Violin</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-orch-2.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>2 String Chords + Harp + Solo Violin + Choir</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-orch-3.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>2 String Chords + Harp + Solo Violin + Choir + Crotales</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-orch-4.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>All of these examples are just using the notes in the first two chords, A minor (A,C,E) and E minor (E,G,B). <i>Note that the long sounds, choir, solo violin and strings are all using expression as we talked about earlier.</i></p><p>You will find examples like the four above across film music literature everywhere.</p><p>There is no limit to what you can do with orchestration, only your imagination. But place limitations on yourself by using common sense, and also use your ears and listen to lots of film scores so you can learn the combinations that work and apply them in your own music.</p><p>To finish off the layering section, here is that opening piece, layered in two different ways: one with strings only, and the other with multiple instruments.</p><h4>Layered Strings</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-stringlayers.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>Layered Strings + Additional Orchestration</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-fulllayers.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>In the second track we have piano, timpani, horns, flutes and trombones. They are all following the same harmony, and the instruments are generally written in the ranges where they sound best. There is nothing particularly elaborate here, but this is a taste of what orchestration can do for your music. However, let's get back to strings.</p><h2>A Brief Introduction to Production</h2><p>So, even after velocity changing, round-robin samples, performance and expression and layering, are we there yet? No. There are still three important parts of the production process that are quite important when dealing with samples. The first being EQ, the second being panning, and the third being reverb. We'll address EQ first.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">Tip 6.</span> EQ</h2><p>When dealing with sampled strings, there tend to be a lot of frequency buildups (especially when layering), and additionally you are constrained to the way the samples were recorded. This can often mean you get unwanted or undesirable sounds.</p><p>Before mixing and doing post-production on tracks, I like to render my tracks to audio stems and then place them in a new project. This allows me to get away from the composition process and think about mixing only. With my audio stems I sort the tracks into groups such as:</p><ul><li>High Strings Short</li><li>Low Strings Short</li><li>High Strings Long</li><li>Low Strings Long</li></ul><p>You can group them however you like, it all depends on your workflow. Once in your sequencer, you should have something that looks like this.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/image/strings-mockups-waves.JPG"></figure><p><i><b>N.B.</b>The waveforms may look distorted but they are not - I prefer to make them bigger in my sequencer so I can see what I'm editing.</i></p><h3><i></i>High Pass Filter<br></h3><p>One of the first things I like to do is remove low-end sound from high-end instruments, for example, the violins. There is nothing really useful in the low end, and with sampled orchestras, when you have a lot of instruments piling up on top of each other, you got low-end frequency buildup, which takes up headroom in your mix and leads to an undesirable sound.<i><br></i></p><h4>High Shorts - No EQ</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-stem-highs.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/image/strings-mockups-eq.JPG"><br></p><p>You can see in the EQ graph and hear how much low-end information there is. It's not really carrying anything useful. Let's isolate it so we can hear it.</p><h4>High Shorts - Isolated Low-End (you may need to turn up your sound)</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-stem-highs-lowend.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>It's mostly rumble. So what we will do, is apply a <i>high pass filter</i><b>&nbsp;</b>on to the strings. This will block out that low-end stuff which is mostly room tone and rumble. We don't need this because later on we will be putting these strings in a room anyway with reverb. We do this because we want our <i>actual</i><b>&nbsp;</b>low-end instruments (cello and bass, etc.) to cut through in the mix.</p><h4>High Shorts - High Pass Filter On/Off</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-stem-highs-eq.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>In the above audio track, every two measures I turn the high pass filter (HPF) on and off.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/image/strings-mockups-eq2.JPG"><br></p><p>Here is a picture of the HPF applied and a frequency graph response after it is applied. The low-end rumble is gone.</p><p>Note that while the difference isn't huge on one track, <i>this is a cumulative effect. </i>The more you do it across your high-end instruments, the more room your low-end instruments (especially percussion) will have to shine.</p><h3>Cut First, Boost Second</h3><p>I always prefer to cut at the mixing stage, and with sampled orchestras—because you are layering lots of instruments together, and not dealing with a real orchestra—instead of having 50 strings playing, you actually have 50 strings playing each note of a chord. In a four note chord, that's 200 strings! So, you're better off cutting.</p><p>The first problem area occurs in sustains (longs) of many libraries, and many of the violins become harsh on the ear after a while of listening to them. To do this, we soften them at the frequency at which they irritate the ear. The 'irritation' frequencies start at <i>~3000 Hz</i>.&nbsp;I use this as a starting point and work from there.&nbsp;</p><p>I also like to roll off some of the very high-end frequencies, as when you have a lot of instruments playing, these build up too. Not so much that it becomes muffled, but just a touch.</p><h4>High Long Strings - Pre EQ</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-stem-long.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>High Long Strings - Post EQ</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-stem-long-eq.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/image/strings-mockups-eq3.JPG"><br></p><p>The difference is subtle, but—like the low pass filter (also applied here)—the effect will be cumulative.</p><p>The other problem area that builds up is the 'mud' area, where my starting point is at <i>~300 Hz.</i> This occurs a lot in mid-range parts, which is where the majority of your orchestra is going to be playing. So, you can look to cut here too. This and the high pass filter is where the biggest differences will be made.</p><h4>Short Strings - No EQ</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-shorts-no-eq.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><h4>Short Strings - EQ</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-shorts-eq.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/image/strings-mockups-eq4.JPG"><br></p><p>You can see the EQ's I've applied on each short string stem based on the advice above.

Every DAW has pan pots, so we should make use of them. For strings, generally speaking, we can either place:</p><ol><li><b>Violin 1 </b>- Left, <b>Violin 2</b> - Right, <b>Viola</b> - Left Center, <b>Cello</b> - Right Center, <b>Bass</b> - Center</li><li><b>Violin 1</b> - Left, <b>Violin 2</b> - Left Center, <b>Viola</b> - Center, <b>Cello</b> - Right Center, <b>Bass</b> - Center</li></ol><p>The first is a more modern setting, and the second is a more classical setting. Honestly, do whatever you think sounds good. Anything is better than placing everything in the center.</p><p>Here is how the track sounds when imaging is applied.</p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-imaging4.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>It's a wider, more panoramic / cinematic sound. It also adds clarity to the mix because each instrument has a bit more space to shine.</p><p>We've come a long way since the original track, but now for the final step.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">Tip 8.</span> Reverb</h2><p>Reverb is one of those things that often comes down to taste. However, when applied correctly, it can really add an extra layer of shine to your track.&nbsp;</p><p>With sampled orchestras especially, you should not skimp on your reverb. It can hide deficiencies in your sample libraries, and also bring to life the good qualities some of them may have.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few tips concerning reverb:</p><ul><li>Don't apply a reverb to the master track, it will muddy up your mix badly.</li><li>Don't apply long reverbs to short sounds, it will muddy up your mix.</li><li>Do apply long reverbs to long sounds, it will help them shine. If your part falls between long and short sounds, then err on the side of caution.</li><li>Be very careful when applying reverb to sounds that register in the lower frequencies, they will kill the headroom in your mix very quickly if not careful.</li><li>Apply your reverb differently according to groups of instruments. One reverb for strings (or high strings and low strings), one reverb for brass, one for high percussion, one for low percussion, and so on. You can either use totally different reverbs for each, or apply the same reverb in differing amounts. Having seen world class mixing engineers work, they all use a lot of different reverbs to dial in their sound. All that matters is <i>what sounds good.</i></li><li>For cinematic music, you'll generally want to stick with a chamber, hall, church or scoring stage reverb, depending on the style of your composition. This is always a good starting point.</li></ul><p>One of the most common things heard in mockups, especially from composers starting out, is too much reverb, or reverb not judiciously applied. Here's what happens when you place a reverb on the master track.</p><h4>Strings Only With Master Reverb</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-masterverb.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>You can hear a lack of clarity in the mix now because the reverb is being applied in the same amount to everything. Lack of clarity is not good. To further illustrate this problem, here is the layered piece from earlier with additional orchestration (and EQ and imaging) with a master reverb applied.</p><h4><b>Strings + Additional Orchestration With Master Reverb</b></h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups-full-masterverb.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>The mix sounds muddy, and this is undesirable. So, <i>following the basic rules that I laid out above,</i> I'll be more careful about my application of reverb to the lower instruments, and be generous with sustained sounds. This should result in more clarity and a better overall mix.</p><h4>Strings Only With Reverb Applied on Different Groups</h4><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups--string-final.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>This is much clearer than when just applying a master reverb.</p><h3>Which Reverb Should I Use?</h3><p>Generally speaking, you should aim to have at least one convolution reverb and one algorithmic reverb. Examples of a convolution reverb are <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.audioease.com%2FPages%2FAltiverb%2F&amp;ei=5j-KU7HREIzaoAT63YGIBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhqnxJoXjlQIZig4DLVDX7jjnkTA&amp;bvm=bv.68191837,d.cGU" rel="external" target="_blank">Altiverb</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundsonline.com%2FSpaces&amp;ei=-T-KU-TrE5G7oQT__4HYAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwP8oj3nw4sE4USA0OWVnuJJE3jg&amp;bvm=bv.68191837,d.cGU" rel="external" target="_blank">Quantum Leap Spaces</a>.

A recommended one is the <a href="http://www.acoustica.com/plugins/vst-directx.htm" rel="external" target="_blank">Kjaerhus Reverb</a>, however you can also look at this <a href="http://audiojungle.net/forums/thread/freebies-best-free-vst-effects/15145" rel="external" target="_blank">excellent AudioJungle forum thread</a>&nbsp;to find various free reverbs (and other goodies).</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">Tip 9.</span> String Library Recommendations</h2><p>It's difficult to recommend one library over another, and ultimately it's better to use your own ears and use them to make the best decision for you. As stated before it's quite easy to make good sample libraries bad, and vice versa.&nbsp;Success in string programming will depend on how you apply the various techniques to improve your mockups, and not just to expect a brilliant out-of-the-box sound (though that does help considerably).</p><p>One thing that's definitely worth considering, though, is having two libraries that each do different things. A good place to start is a library which deals with ensemble playing, and then get a supplemental library for when you need detail.&nbsp;</p><p>Ensemble library examples (not an exhaustive list):</p><ul><li><a href="http://8dio.com/instrument/adagietto/" rel="external" target="_blank">8Dio Adagietto</a></li><li><a href="http://www.spitfireaudio.com/about-the-albion-range.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Spitfire Audio Albion 1/2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.projectsam.com/Products/Symphobia-Series#productmenubar" rel="external" target="_blank">ProjectSAM Symphobia 1</a></li><li><a href="http://www.sonokinetic.net/products/classical/dacapo/" rel="external" target="_blank">Sonokinetic Da Capo</a></li></ul><p>Detail library examples (not an exhaustive list):</p><ul><li><a href="http://8dio.com/instrument/bundle-9-all-adagio-strings/" rel="external" target="_blank">8Dio Adagio</a></li><li><a href="http://audiobro.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">LA Scoring Strings</a></li><li><a href="http://www.soundsonline.com/Hollywood-Strings" rel="external" target="_blank">Hollywood Strings</a></li><li><a href="http://www.orchestraltools.com/libraries/berlin_strings.php" rel="external" target="_blank">Berlin Strings</a></li><li><a href="http://cinesamples.com/product/cinestrings-core" rel="external" target="_blank">CineStrings</a></li></ul><p>All libraries have their own strengths and weaknesses.

We then looked at the post-production process for string mockups, and added EQ, imaging and reverb. The result was a track that sounded like this.<br></p><audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/347/posts/21216/audio/strings-mockups--string-final.mp3" controls="controls"></audio><p><br></p><p>The road to improving string mockups is endless, and developers will keep finding new ways to sample strings. It's up to the user to make their libraries sound as good as possible, but even if you are limited with your choice of libraries, you are less limited with your choice of instruments, and that's where a knowledge of orchestration can come into play.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, if you want to write a string-only piece you might have to spend more time really enhancing your string sound, but if you are writing for orchestra and using only samples, you can mix and match your good samples to cover up the bad ones. With a solid orchestration knowledge base, you can turn a strings-only track into something quite grand, even when the new parts are just playing the same notes as the original strings.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this tutorial was enlightening.

However, there are many everyday uses for Wolfram|Alpha that go unnoticed. In fact, Wolfram|Alpha is the brains behind Siri, a tool you may use everyday to find out new information.</p><p>In this tutorial, I'll show you seven ways to put the web app to use as a helpful tool for everyday processes.</p>

<h2>Conversions</h2>

<p>Converting units is really easy to do in Wolfram|Alpha. To convert units, all you need to do is enter <strong>Convert X units to new units</strong>, where X units is the amount of an item you have and new units is what you want to measure in, into the <strong>search bar</strong>. Wolfram|Alpha then computes the value in your preferred units and also provides equivalents in other units.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A pounds to kilograms conversion" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-conversionsNEW.jpg"><figcaption>A <strong>pounds to kilograms</strong> conversion.</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Finding Nutritional Values</h2>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha is extremely powerful when it comes to finding the nutritional values of food, even brand-name items like candies or menu items. To find the nutritional value of a food, just type the name of the food and the amount you plan to eat into the <strong>search bar</strong>, and Wolfram|Alpha will spit out values for every nutritional aspect of the food.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for the nutritional value of a hamburger" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-nutrition.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for the nutritional value of a <strong>hamburger</strong>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>If you're looking for a specific nutritional aspect of a food, you can simply type queries like <strong>total fat</strong>, <strong>calories</strong>, or <strong>caffeine</strong> in a certain food item, and the results will be stripped down to include what you're looking for right on the surface.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for total calories in a hamburger" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-calories.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for <strong>total calories in a hamburger</strong>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<p>Nutritional value can be computed for entire meals at once as well. By entering each item in your meal—separated by the word "<strong>and</strong>"—you can see the combined nutritional value of the whole meal on one page.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for nutritional value of hamburger and fries" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-mealnutrition.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for nutritional value of <strong>hamburger and fries</strong>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> For more accurate results, Wolfram|Alpha gives the option to specify different brands of foods, as nutritional value does fluctuate depending on how healthful the brand is.</p>

<h2>Generating Passwords</h2>

<p>While Wolfram|Alpha's password generator is quite a simple concept, its definitely one of the most overlooked features the app has to offer. Random passwords can aid your security both online and offline, which is essential in our digital era.</p>

<p>To generate a password, simply type <strong>generate password</strong> into the <strong>search bar</strong>. You can even refine your random password by specifying the amount of characters you want in it, and determining whether or not you want numbers, lowercase or uppercase letters, or even special characters in the password.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="WolframAlpha generates random secure passwords" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-generatepassword.jpg"><figcaption>Wolfram|Alpha generates random secure passwords.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<p>For each password generated, Wolfram|Alpha displays a <strong>phonetic form</strong> of the password, which can serve as a mnemonic to memorize the password easily.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="Phonetic forms can serve as a mnemonic to remember the password" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-password2.jpg"><figcaption>Phonetic forms can serve as a mnemonic to remember the password.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Linguistics</h2>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha's linguistic capabilities are top notch. By searching queries like <strong>word [word]</strong>, you're able to gather basically anything you'd want to know about the word you searched.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for the word spring" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-spring.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for the <strong>word spring</strong>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>A general search of a word will present you with the definitions of the word first, then will display pronunciation, etymology, word usage over time, synonyms, broader and narrower terms for the same word, and even rhymes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specific search queries, such as <strong>define [word]</strong>, <strong>synonyms for [word]</strong>, or <strong>etymology of [word]</strong>, may also be conducted, and the results will be stripped back to display the aspects you want above all else.</p>

<figure class="post_image">&nbsp;<img alt="A WolframAlpha search for synonyms for spring" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-synonyms.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for <strong>synonyms for spring</strong>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha also has the power to translate words from one language to another. To do so, enter <strong>translate [word] to [language]</strong>. While its translation algorithms are not as strong as Google Translate, they do work pretty well.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha translation" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-translate.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha translation.</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Shopping</h2>

<p>The pain of shopping—both online and offline—can be greatly reduced by using Wolfram|Alpha</p>

<h3>Finding Specific Products</h3>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha may be used as an all-in-one catalog to greatly streamline the online shopping process.</p>

<p>If you're looking for the best deal on a product, all you need to do is search <strong>cheapest [product]</strong>. Wolfram|Alpha will not only pull the price of the cheapest item, but pictures, specs, ratings, and the closest equivalents to the product at hand as well as their prices and ratings.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for the cheapest camera" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-camera.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for the <strong>cheapest camera</strong>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can also scope out a whole market of products by searching <strong>[product] under $X</strong>, which will list all the products on the market under that price point.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for all cameras under 100" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-cameras.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for all <strong>cameras under $100</strong>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>When looking at a price range, features among the models are &nbsp;compared, so you know if you're getting your money's worth with the item you're buying.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A comparison of features among cameras under 100" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-camerafeatures.jpg"><figcaption>A comparison of features among cameras under $100.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<p>Additionally, your search can be limited by specifying a brand or feature, which will yield results that are only manufactured by that company or have that feature respectively.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A brand-specific search for Canon cameras" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-canoncameras.jpg"><figcaption>A brand-specific search for <strong>Canon cameras</strong>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<h3>Locating a Store</h3>

<p>Finding local brick-and-mortar stores is easy in Wolfram|Alpha. To find a store nearest you, search <strong>nearest [store name]</strong>, and the nearest location as well as the distance will be displayed at the top of the page.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for the nearest CVS store" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-neareststore.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for the <strong>nearest CVS</strong> store.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Further down the page, the five nearest locations are displayed, along with whether or not they are open at the time of the search. There also is a map that gives general directions about how to get to the nearest location.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-neareststoremap.jpg"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>The same can be done in reference to a location other than the one you currently are in by searching <strong>nearest [store name] to [landmark]</strong>.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for the nearest CVS to Ambassador Bridge" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-storelandmark.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for the <strong>nearest CVS to Ambassador Bridge</strong>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can search by store hours as well, especially if you need to find a store open at an odd hour. To do so, search&nbsp;<strong>[location][store name] stores open at [time]</strong>, and Wolfram|Alpha will find the nearest locations of that store that are open at that hour.<br></p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for Detroit CVS stores open at 9 PM" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-openstores.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for <strong>Detroit CVS stores open at 9 PM</strong>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha can also locate stores that carry a specific item. For example, you can find nearby drugstores by searching <strong>nearest drugstore</strong>, and Wolfram|Alpha will find drugstores near you.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search for the nearest drugstore" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-nearestdrugstore.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search for the <strong>nearest drugstore</strong>.</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Weather</h2>

<p>Wolfram|Alpha creates some of the most comprehensive weather reports that are available on the internet. Simply searching <strong>weather forecast</strong> not only yields the temperature outside on the current date, but also visuals that depict rainfall, windspeed, cloud cover, and historical high and low temperatures.</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="Weather forecast yields both a visual representation of the weather as well as specific details" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-weather.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Weather forecast</strong> yields both a visual representation of the weather as well as specific details.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Longer reports can be produced simply by searching <strong>X day weather forecast</strong>, where X is the number of days you'd like the weather report to cover.</p><p>Searches can also be conducted on specific aspects of the weather, such as chance of rain or the maximum temperature for the day.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="post_image"><img alt="A WolframAlpha search query for high temperature today" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/81/posts/21195/image/computers-tutsplus-WA-hightemp.jpg"><figcaption>A Wolfram|Alpha search query for <strong>high temperature today</strong>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>

<h2><span class="sectionnum">1. </span>Prepare the Dye<br></h2><h3>Step 1</h3><br><p>In this tutorial I will show you how to get the 'indigo look' by using synthetic blue dye. First of all you need to prepare the fabric dye.&nbsp;</p><p>Heat some water and mix the fabric dye, the fixative and salt (optional) in the vat, either by following the instructions on the packet of dye you're using, or by following my instructions in my <a href="http://crafts.tutsplus.com/tutorials/shibori-for-beginners-ne-maki-technique--cms-20686" rel="external" target="_blank">shibori for beginners tutorial</a>. Make sure to wear gloves and protective garments to avoid getting messy. If you want to protect your floor or working surface, use a plastic drop-sheet.<b><i><br></i></b></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/05-tie-dye-prepare%20the%20dye.JPG"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">2. </span>Wrap the T-Shirt&nbsp;</h2><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Once your indigo vat is ready you can start wrapping your T-shirt. It is best to use a plain white made from pure cotton or other natural fibres. Lay the clean T-shirt on your working surface with the front side facing downwards. <br></p><p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/1-shibori%20t-shirt.JPG"><br></p><h3>Step 2</h3><p>Make two vertical folds, bringing the sleeves inwards on the main body of the T-shirt. Make sure that the folds are straight and vertical and try to smooth any wrinkles on the fabric. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/2-shibori%20t-shirt-fold.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 3</h3><p>Wrap the T-shirt around a rod. Use a rod you don't mind getting dyed. An old mop or broom handle will be fine for this job. Now place your rod on the top of your T-Shirt near the neckline. Place it parallel to the neckline. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/3-shibori%20t-shirt-place%20pole.JPG"></figure><p>Bring the fabric upwards and wrap it around the rod using both hands. You could also wrap the T-shirt around the rod diagonally to emphasize the storm effect in the final design.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/4-shibori%20t-shirt-wrap.JPG"></figure><p>Keep rolling the rod and tightly wrapping the T-Shirt around it. &nbsp;<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/5-shibori%20t-shirt-wrap.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 4</h3><p>Cut a long piece of thread or twine using a pair of scissors.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/6-shibori%20t-shirt-cut%20string.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 5</h3><p>Make a double knot on the lower end of the T-shirt. Keep a long piece of twine on one side of the knot and a short piece on the other.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/7-shibori%20t-shirt-knot.JPG"></figure><p>Now, trim the shorter end of the twine as close as possible to the knot.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/7b-shibori%20t-shirt-knot.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 6</h3><p>Start wrapping the twine around the rod, tying the T-shirt tightly as you move upwards. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/8-shibori%20t-shirt-wrap%20string.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 7</h3><p>Once you reach the top of the T-shirt, keep tying the twine around the rod and come back downwards. When you reach the bottom, secure the thread in place by making a double knot and trim the excess end. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/9-shibori%20t-shirt-wrap%20string.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 8</h3><p>Now hold one end of the rod and move the T-shirt down the rod with the other hand. Squeeze it as much as possible to create a scrunched effect on the fabric.<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/10-shibori%20t-shirt-push.JPG"></figure><h2><span class="sectionnum">3. </span>Dye it Blue</h2><h3>Step 1<br></h3><p>Now that your T-shirt is properly tied on the rod, it's ready to be dyed. First, soak it in cold water. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/11-shibori%20t-shirt-wet.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 2<br></h3><p>Then place the fabric on the pole into the dye vat. Sink it first as horizontally as possible to dye most of the surface of the cloth. But don't leave it like that for too long! Hold the pole more upright and let it rest in the dye for 20 to 30 minutes. Keep in mind that the longer you leave it in, the stronger the color will be. <br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/12-shibori%20t-shirt-die.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 3<br></h3><p>Once you've allowed the T-shirt to rest for the required amount of time in the dye vat, remove the pole and rinse the tied fabric under a cold water tap until the water runs clear.&nbsp; </p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/13-shibori%20t-shirt-wash.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 4<br></h3><p>Cut the twine and unwrap it carefully from the T-shirt. You will notice that the twine has blocked the dye and the wrapped parts have remained white. This is what actually creates your own unique pattern.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/193/posts/20874/image/14-shibori%20t-shirt-untie.JPG"></figure><h3>Step 5<br></h3><p>Unroll the T-shirt from the rod.

But before we look at ay of&nbsp;code, I think it's important to understand the concepts of importance, to look at a few of the steps necessary to prepare object-oriented code for inheritance.</p><p>In this article, we're going to be&nbsp;defining inheritance, trying to form a conceptual model of what's actually going on, examining the nuances of what are known as base classes and subclasses, as well as some of the reserved keywords in the language that must be adjusted in order to support inheritance through out classes.</p><p>So with that set aside as our roadmap for the article, let's go ahead and get started.</p><h2>Inheritance Defined</h2><p>Unlike a number of other programming terms, inheritance is actually a word that describes it's concept pretty well. Straight from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)" rel="external" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote>In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object or class, using the same implementation. It is a mechanism for code reuse. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a hierarchy.<br></blockquote><p>Relatively clear, isn't it? But I think we can do better.</p><p>Earlier in this series, we talked about how many of the more common programming languages use examples such as <code class="inline">Animals</code> and <code class="inline">Vehicles</code> as a way to demonstrate the concept of object-oriented programming.</p><p>After all, the idea behind object-oriented programming is that we should be modeling real-world objects? Well, sort of. But how many times have you seen a physical <code class="inline">Blog_Post</code>?</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>As such, I always like to try to put things in the perspective of something that's far more tangible, more practical, and that's more closely related to the content that we'll actually be creating.</p><p>With that said, what's an adequate way we can describe inheritance within the context of object-oriented programming that doesn't wreck the concept through the use of trivial examples?</p><p>Let's try this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Inheritance is when one class serves as the parent class for a child class that provides a number of attributes and methods common to both the parent and child; however, the child as the ability to introduce it's own attributes.</blockquote><p>In the quote above, we're using a couple of terms like "parent class" and "child class" each of which we'll clarify in a little bit, but the point is that we can literally create a hierarchy of classes all of which&nbsp;<i>inherit</i> information from their parent classes.</p><p>Perhaps even neater, whenever you're working with a child class and you want to take advantage of attributes and functions defined in the parent class or the base class, you can easily do so with no extra code.</p><p>But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Before we do that, let's make sure that we can get a conceptual model of what inheritance looks like. After all, although we're writing code, we're trying to provide a model that not only represents an actual object, but creates a relationship between the objects, too.</p><h2>Visualizing Inheritance</h2><p>Before we go any further, let's take a look at a very simple class diagram as to how inheritance works.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/34/posts/21379/image/diagram.png"></figure><figure class="post_image">Note that we're using three classes:</figure><ul><li><code class="inline">Content</code> which will serve as the base class and that represents a generic type of information that holds data for other, more specific types of content.</li><li><code class="inline">Comment</code> which represents a comment on a blog post. This class contains information that it inherits from <code class="inline">Content</code> and that it defines within itself.</li><li><code class="inline">Post</code> also inherits from <code class="inline">Content</code> which represents a single blog post. It contains general <code class="inline">Content</code> information, but also contains its own information specific to that class.</li></ul><p>Now, this is clearly a simplified example of inheritance, but at its core this&nbsp;<i>is</i> how inheritance works. In a future article, we'll take a look at how instantiation, data access, and other features work, as well.</p><p>But first, we still need to clarify a few terms and make sure that we have all of the proper information.</p><h2>Class Jargon</h2><p>As we've touched on earlier in this series, there are a number of terms that we've used all of which are key to understanding how the various pieces of inheritance work together.</p><p>To that end, it's important to define some common definitions for the words that we're using not only because of how we're using them throughout this article because you're not only going to see them used here, but you're going to see them used elsewhere and you're going to see them used interchangeably in other articles throughout the web:</p><ul><li>A parent class, also referred to as a base class, is the class from which other classes inherit information as demonstrated in the illustration above. It maintains a set of properties and functions.</li><li>Note that some of the functions that are available in the base class to third-party classes, the child classes, or&nbsp;<i>only</i> within the base class itself.</li><li>The child class, typically called the subclass, is the class that inherits information, data, and functionality from its parent class.&nbsp;</li><li>We'll look at code about this in the next post; however, note that access to data only goes one way. That is, subclasses can access information in their base class, but base classes are unaware of their subclasses.</li></ul><p>This&nbsp;<i>should</i> clear up a lot of of the terminology around this; however, if not, think of it in terms of, say, a family tree where you have parents and children. Children inherit traits from their parents, but parents do not inherit traits from their children.</p><p>Note also that, in programming, some developers want to introduce what's called "multiple inheritance" which basically means that a single class can inherit properties and methods from multiple classes.</p><p>Not only is this restricted in PHP, but it's also outside the scope of this particular series.</p><h2>An Aside for Abstract Classes</h2><p>For those who are a little more familiar with the concept of inheritance, then you're likely also familiar with the concept of abstract classes.</p><p>Then again, if you're familiar with the concept of abstract classes, I'd argue that you're not a beginner and you aren't really the target audience for the content that we're reaching with this article.&nbsp;</p><p>So depending on the feedback on this article, this series, and if others are interested, perhaps we can do a follow-up article or a couple of articles that covers this exact topic.</p><h2>Coming Up Next...</h2><p>In the next article, we're going to continue our discussion on inheritance as we take a look at how to implement it within PHP.&nbsp;We're also going to be taking a look at how subclasses can access data from their parents, and how parent classes can secure information within themselves</p><p>In the meantime, be sure to leave any feedback, questions, and/or comments about inheritance in the comment feed and I'll look to address them here or in the next post.</p><p>Until then!</p><div class="mediafed_ad"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://audio.tutsplus.com.feedsportal.com/c/35227/f/669438/s/21379/sc/4/mf.gif" width="1" /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21379/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21379/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186529796139/u/407/f/669438/c/35227/s/21379/a2t.img" width="1" /></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:9:"published";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-11T15:00:45.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"2014-06-11T15:00:45.000Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"
